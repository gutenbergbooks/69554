<small>ARU</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">“LAND HO! fellows—yonder to the east.
Can you make it out?”</p>

<p>The two youths beside the tall man who
had spoken shaded their eyes from the tropical
glare and searched the cloud banks on the
horizon of the blue Banda Sea.</p>

<p>“I think I see it, sir,” said Dwight. “Part
of those clouds seem to have faint white lines
in them.”</p>

<p>“I see it!” exclaimed Nicky, peering
through his glasses. “It’s developing out
like a camera plate—high, jungly mountains
that seem to be floating in the clouds. I see
dark spaces now, with streaks of sunlight edging
the outlines of the hills. Hurrah for Aru!”</p>

<p>“That’s not Aru; that’s Ke’,” returned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
man. “Aru is too low and flat to be seen yet.
It lies to the east of Ke’. Our bungalow is on
Kobror, the southernmost of the Aru Islands;
we ought to pass the port of Dobbo in a few
hours.”</p>

<p>The three white men were standing before
a small palm-thatched deck house which was
their home on the Malay proa <i>Kuching</i>.
Curator Baldwin of the National Museum
was their leader. He was a tall, rangy giant
of a man, his sinewy frame clad in tropical
khaki, with the inevitable puttees of the
East accentuating the muscular leanness of
his long legs. One placed him easily—mining
engineer or leader of a scientific field party,
captain of his team in college days, most
likely, that commanding sort of man to whom
exploration in dangerous out-of-the-way places
is all in the day’s work.</p>

<p>And the choleric blue eyes that looked a
man in the eye from under his pith helmet,
the sunburnt face with its gray mustache
and firm chin, warned the casual stranger that
here was the last man in the world to trifle
with.</p>

<p>The two youths beside him were scarcely
less noteworthy. Their resolute, weather-tanned
young faces bespoke the hardy outdoorsmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of the same breed, but younger, as
the curator. Dwight was tall and spare,
with a keen hatchet face and merry gray-green
eyes that twinkled at one when he
talked, yet they could grow hard and cold as
ice in time of peril. Nicky was stout; habitually
good-humored, habitually chuckling over
the least joke, and always finding one and
making himself the butt of it on every occasion.
They were a great team; always “joshing”
each other, always differing on every
conceivable subject, yet devoted to each
other and to the curator, whom they adored
as an athlete and admired as a scientist.
For two years they had been his assistants on
expeditions in Africa and in British Guiana.
He had picked them for this trip because of
their tried and proven resourcefulness in facing
conditions as they found them in wild
lands. As unlike, physically, as two boys
could be, they were alike in one thing—their
sturdy independence of character. Original
in everything they did, they copied no one,
neither in their outdoor equipment nor in their
ways of living when in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Malay proa on which the party was
sailing bore the house flag of the museum
floating from the end of her seventy-foot foreyard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
In these days of interisland steamers
you will not see so many of her type, once
the most common craft of the Banda Sea.
Her sails were huge mats of palm-fiber; her
masts tripods of bamboo; and her body,
built on Ke’ by the greatest boat builders
of the Malay Archipelago, was of hewn logs,
doweled together along their edges and secured
by ribs of teak bent in and lashed with
rattan to projections on her planks. There
was not an iron nail or a spike in her anywhere,
but the curator had chartered her for
the museum’s field expeditions among the
islands as the best ship for the purpose, for
her crew of Javanese and Bugis cost but their
rations of rice and fish, with a small wage,
and she could sail anywhere and be repaired
at any island with native palm and rattan.</p>

<p>Over the smooth rollers of the Banda Sea
she bowled southward on the east monsoon,
steadily rising the low hills of Aru to the east.
By midafternoon she had come off Dobbo, the
principal pearl port of the Aru Islands, and
the captain altered her course slightly, heading
for the coast of Kobror, the wildest of the
two great mainlands of Aru.</p>

<p>Out of the coral reefs that surround the
harbor of Dobbo put forth a long, black canoe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Her crew of naked blacks foamed up the water
in spats of spray with their paddles, singing
and shouting as they came. Up in her high
carved prow sat a white man, dressed in the
cottons of the equatorial tropics, with a
Japanese-bowl hat sheltering his head from
the sun. He rose and waved them a greeting
as his canoe drew near.</p>

<p>“Proa ahoy! I say, are you there, Baldwin?”
he shouted. “I’m going on to Kobror
with you.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Bentham! That’s fine, old man!
Come right aboard and we’ll have tiffin....
Did you get my letter? These mail steamers
only touch Aru about once in a dog’s age, they
tell me. How are you, old new-chum?” greeted
the curator, grasping Bentham’s hand as the
canoe shot alongside and her crew of mop-haired
Papuans leaped aboard to mingle with
their own crew.</p>

<p>“How am I, dea-rr man? My word! Rippin’!
Yes, I got your letter, doncherknow.
Have a bungalow for you; I fancy it’s more or
less done in, but it’s out in the jungle, as you
wanted,” he replied, shaking hands heartily.</p>

<p>“It was mighty good of you, Bentham!”
thanked the curator. “We’ll fix it up and
make it our headquarters while down here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
We’re stopping on Kobror a day or so after
paradise birds.”</p>

<p>He turned to introduce Dwight and Nicky,
who had been studying Bentham curiously.
The bold, independent swagger of the Australian
was written in every line of his sunburnt
face. He was the representative of the
Aru pearl company, the curator had told
them, sole white man in a whole group of
islands peopled by native black savages.</p>

<p>They led the pearl trader to their house
on deck, where the Javanese cook served
tiffin. It was a cozy little retreat, about
ten feet square by perhaps six high, and was
built of bamboo arches thatched with palm-leaf
attap. Its floor was raised some six
inches above the wet deck by springy bamboo
poles laid side by side, and the thatch walls
were lined with fragrant sandalwood boxes,
which also served for bunks.</p>

<p>Bentham was pathetically glad to see them,
eager to talk and talk of the war and the
world’s doings, with all the pensive loneliness
of a white man condemned to months and
months of existence with no other associates
than Papuan natives and Chinese traders.
The curator and the boys filled him up with
news to his heart’s content. Just to hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
their voices in the good old mother tongue
once more, to feel their keen minds sympathetic
with his own, was pleasure enough,
and Bentham basked luxuriantly in it.</p>

<p>“Where to next, after Kobror, Baldwin?”
he asked, after a pause in the flow of news.</p>

<p>“Dutch New Guinea,” puffed the curator.
“That’s our main drive this time. Our
proa sails for there in a day or so.”</p>

<p>“Dutch New Guinea!” The trader’s face
grew suddenly grave. “My word, man!
Have you read Captain Rawling’s report of
the British expedition up the Mimika? Or
about the Dutchman, Lorentz’s, dash to
peak Wilhelmina in the Snow Mountains?
He’s the only one who has got to them, so
far.”</p>

<p>“Sure! We’re familiar with all that. But
I can say this to you, Bentham, you being
an Australian: the trouble with the British,
and with the Dutch, too, is that they can’t
get away from the <i>safari</i> idea. Get me?
Every one of their expeditions failed because
of it. Your Englishman must have his tub
and his champagne, his big tents and heavy
camp furniture, his tinned sweetmeats and
what not, and it takes an army of porters to
carry it all. He learned the <i>safari</i> idea in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Africa; but it won’t work in New Guinea,
because you can neither move a <i>safari</i> through
the jungle nor live off the country with it.
The British were a year and a half on the
Mimika, and they never got within forty
miles of the Snow Mountains. It took them
five weeks to cut a <i>safari</i> trail three miles
long. All that country, from the Great
Precipice to the sea, is a flat, dense jungle,
with the rivers running through it so swiftly
that they are impossible to ascend. They
contented themselves with plane-table surveys
made from a clearing in the jungle, and
before long their army of porters died like
flies of beriberi.</p>

<p>“We are going to try the American idea,”
he continued, “going light—‘pigging it,’
the British call it—but it gets you somewhere.
We’ll take our own light, concentrated
foods along, and live off the country
on wallabys and wild pig for fresh meat.
There’ll be plenty for us.”</p>

<p>“But, man dea-rr—the danger!” objected
Bentham. “These Aru niggers, here, had
the fear of God dynamited into them some
forty years ago, and they’ll jolly well never
touch a white man again! But it’s different
in Dutch New Guinea. They’re cannibals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and head hunters, and most of them
have never even seen a white man. The
English territory is somewhat policed, but,
my word! the Dutch have only two small
posts six hundred miles apart on the whole
west coast! You’ve heard of the Tugeri
head hunters? Many a time our soldiers
have chased them over the border—where
they stay, to raid us again whenever they
feel like it—as jolly a bunch of cannibals
as ever cut a throat. And the pygmies of
the mountains! My word! Your little party
would be massacred the first step ashore.
What could you do against fifty of them, or
a hundred?”</p>

<p>“Oh—we’ll manage!” twinkled the curator,
mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Man dea-rr, it’s foolhardiness! Here, let
me give you some dynamite sticks, anyway.
It’s plain suicide to go ashore without it.
Our expedition, with its army of porters,
was all right—but you!”</p>

<p>“Say, Bentham, there’s been a war, you
know!” laughed the curator, “and I was in
it—lieutenant of a trench-bombing detail.
Dynamite is old stuff, now. I’ve brought
a few grenades along, if we have any trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’ll need ’em for those blighters!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
exclaimed Bentham. “So you were in
France, eh?” The regret in his own tones
told how keenly it galled him to have been
stuck down here out of it all. The talk
went back to the war again, of which he
could never get enough.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re going to try a new tack in a
new way,” said the curator, when they got
back to the expedition again. “We’re going
to land in that long lagoon at the head of
Dorgo Bay. No white men have ever been
in that way. The mountains come right
close to shore there, and we can get on high
ground right off and avoid that swampy
jungle. Then, southward along the ridges
above the Great Precipice for ours, and we’ll
see what we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said Bentham, shaking his head,
“good luck to you! But the pygmies or the
Outanatas will get you sure! You’ll have to
wade through dynamite the whole way!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re not exactly unprepared, you
know,” demurred the curator. He showed him
a curious pistol that the boys had often
speculated over. It looked like a foreign
automatic, only its barrel was a mere shell
of steel, like a shotgun, and it had no hammer
or firing mechanism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“I had this made. Sort of shell thrower,
you know. It’s rather effective at moderate
ranges—shoots T. N. T. shells. It pays to
look ahead in these expeditions and try to
meet conditions as you imagine them likely
to turn out. Force, and plenty of it, is the
only thing the savage really understands,
so we’re fixed to defend ourselves if we have
to.”</p>

<p>Bentham looked relieved. “But suppose
you get captured and tied up?” he questioned.
“Those beggars will eat you, sure—like
you all the better if you are white.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been tied up before. Mundurucus,
up the Orinoco. But I didn’t <i>stay</i> tied long.”</p>

<p>He twirled a ring on his right hand with
his thumb as the others looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>“Picked this up from an old <i>guru</i> up in
the Himalayas. Came out of some Indian
palace, most likely. I bet it’s got a history!”
He pressed the monogram of the ring with
his thumb tip as they watched. It was all
done with one hand, but out of its base a
tiny, two-edged steel knife stuck up from
the base of the monogram. “You twist your
wrist, with that ring knife inside, you see,
and you’d be surprised to see how easy it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
to cut a thong around your wrists with it,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Shouts on deck interrupted the boys’
exclamations of astonishment and brought
them running out of the cabin. The mainland
of Kobror lay off not a mile to windward.
The crew were tacking ship, and all
was shouting and confusion.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better get our outfits ready,
boys,” said the curator. “Call Sadok and
Baderoon, so we can muster the party and
see that they have everything.”</p>

<p>Presently Dwight returned, followed by
Sadok and Baderoon. The former was a
hill Dyak, the “star” bird hunter of their
party. He came up, completely armed, with
his long sumpitan, or blowgun, of Borneo in
hand, and on his left arm was a conical shield
of bamboo. A steel parang-ihlang hung at
his belt, and over his shoulder was suspended
the bamboo quiver of darts for the blowgun.
His muscular brown arms and shoulders
glistened in the sunlight which glinted on the
gold and silver threads of his gorgeous chawat
and the dull jewels that studded his jacket.</p>

<p>“What have you got for a sleeping rig in
the jungle, Sadok?” inquired the curator
as the Dyak stood waiting inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Sadok turned him around, exposing the
tightly rolled cadjan, or native mat, hung
on his back. Unrolled, it would be about
four feet square, and it was house, blanket,
mattress, and umbrella in one to him, for
one corner of it was sewed into a pocket, so
that he could wear the thing over his head
when it rained.</p>

<p>“You’ll do, Sadok. Mr. Bentham, here,
will assign you some black boys to carry up
our stuff when we land. You’ll take charge
of them.”</p>

<p>“A’right, Orang-kaya!” grinned Sadok, and
went forward among the crew again.</p>

<p>“Baderoon next!” called the curator.
“What you-fellah got to take ’long beach?”</p>

<p>Baderoon burst into boisterous Papuan
merriment and did a handspring on deck.
All he owned in the world was the long bow
in his hand and a string about his middle,
with a quiver of arrows dangling from it.
His dress hardly needed taking off at night.
There was a brass ring around one arm, with
some tufts of human hair ornamenting it,
whose owner had been eaten long ago—details
obscure if you asked Baderoon!—and
there was a three-pronged comb stuck
into the long frizzles of his mop of hair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Then, he wore a small tin mirror hanging
by a string from his nose, and when Baderoon
had put on that prized possession he
had said the last word in dandyism!</p>

<p>“Here, Baderoon-fellah, catch’m blanket!”
said the curator, tossing him a spare one.
“And mind you don’t wear it about your
neck, the way the Wanderobos did when the
English forbade them to come into town
without a blanket to cover their nakedness!”</p>

<p>Baderoon exploded in a gust of merriment
and tied the blanket decorously about his
waist. At a sign of dismissal he went forward
to rejoin Sadok. The proa was now
tacking in through the coral reefs. A fleet
of black canoes came out from the village on
shore to meet her. The paddlers scrambled
aboard and immediately surrounded the white
men, pointing and gesticulating with unslaked
Papuan curiosity. Their long noses hooked
at them like parrots’ beaks as they cackled
boisterously, fingering freely and unabashed
the clothing and equipment of the whites.</p>

<p>In a final reach the proa ran hard aground
on the white sand beach, and everyone prepared
to jump ashore over her bow.</p>

<p>“So long, for the present, Baldwin,” said
Bentham, shaking hands. “I’ve got some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
pearl business to attend to here with the
chief, and I sha’n’t see you again. These
rotters will carry up your luggage as your
man directs. Send for me if you need anything.”</p>

<p>He nodded cordially and was off into the
village of Wamba, which straggled along the
shore under lines of coco palms. They
landed and went up its one street, followed
by a long line of black porters, each with a
single article balanced on his head. The
veranda of their bungalow peeped out of the
jungle on a low hillside at the end of the
street. Bamboos hovered over it thickly,
their nodding willow-leaved foliage almost
hiding its thatched roof from view. Here
all their outfit was set down and the curator
began settling like an old campaigner.</p>

<p>The boys sat out on the veranda, looking
down on the main street of Wamba with the
keenest interest. The tall peaked gables of
the thatch houses lined both sides of the
sandy road. Each house was made of long
bamboo poles, laid up A-shaped like a wedge
tent and lashed with rattan at their tops.
Every foot of the street seemed covered with
busy people, for everybody’s business was
being transacted out in the main road, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
everyone’s way. There were mop-headed
Papuan natives, strolling around with bundles
of sugar cane over their shoulders;
Javanese sailors in their conical straw hats,
buying parrots from turbaned Mohammedan
Bugis; Chinese merchants buying sago
bread from more naked natives, who carried
it by a yoke and two slings like a pair of
Dutch pails; more Javanese, repairing a
proa plank with native adzes; and a constant
stream of Aru hunters and fishermen,
coming in with fowl, trepang, mother-of-pearl
shells, birds, and coconut shells in
baskets. For domestic pets there were pigs,
kangaroos, goats, tame bobos (pelicans), and
parrots everywhere, wandering at will about
the street or swinging from a perch under
the thatch porches.</p>

<p>Then a native hunter came wandering by,
with a spotted cuscus, or native opossum,
hanging by its tail, and him the curator
snared, to buy the specimen from him and
engage the man for a guide to the <i>blakangtana</i>,
the jungle hinterland, next day.</p>

<p>Tiring of the noisy scene at length, Dwight
went inside and lay down on a cool rattan
lounge, leaving Nicky to help sort collection
boxes with the curator. After reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
awhile, he lay down the book with a sigh
of content and looked idly up into the thatch
that was thickly woven through the poles
of their roof. Indolently gazing, he noticed
a dark mass overhead, seemingly buried in
the thatch. Examining it more carefully,
he could see yellow and black marks, and
concluded that it must be a tortoise shell
that some one had left there. But the thing
still fascinated him, and every little while
he would look up at it again, while the others
went on with the business of settling the
house. Then a slight rustle in the thatch
attracted him, and, gazing up at it steadily
again, it suddenly resolved itself into a large
snake, compactly coiled up in a kind of knot!
Dwight’s jaw dropped as he detected the
head and its bright eyes in the very center
of the folds.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, fellows!” he called out, jumping
to his feet, “here’s a boa constrictor, a
python!—up in our roof!”</p>

<p>The curator jumped up the steps of the
veranda in a bound. “Where! Show me
him!” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Right up there!” laughed Dwight, quivering
with excitement. “And making himself
at home just as nice as nice!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Sadok started to draw his parang, but
the curator stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he commanded. “We don’t want
to spoil his skin.”</p>

<p>Baderoon came running in. “Me kill’m!
Me catch’m tailie! Me kill plenty snake on
Bouru!” he yelled, begging the curator for
permission to show them.</p>

<p>The latter smiled quietly. “Clear out,
boys—and watch the fun!” he said, picking
up the lamp off the table and sweeping a
lot of small things out of the way. “Ever
see a native kill a python? I guess the house
will stand it! Go get’m Baderoon-fellah!”</p>

<p>Baderoon jumped for the rafters, and there
was a violent commotion in the thatch as
he dropped down with the tip of the boa’s
tail in both hands. He and Sadok tugged
away at it, soon ripping down about ten feet
of the writhing coils, while the others ran
laughing for the door. The commotion
inside increased, and then there was a heavy
thump and the crash of chairs and tables
upset and flying about, and then Baderoon
emerged, running down the steps with about
thirty feet of snake behind him, twisting
and lashing with its thick coils. The python
swept everything with him and made a last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
stand with its neck hooked about a veranda
post, while the boys yelled and catcalled
with glee. Then Baderoon tore him loose
and, running fast, flew with him toward
the jungle, where, stopping suddenly, he
snapped the snake’s long body like a whiplash
and smashed his head against a tree.</p>

<p>“Whee!” yelled Nicky, delightedly, from
the veranda. “Me for the next one! Gee!
I’d like to try that stunt!”</p>

<p>But the python was not nearly dead yet,
and he started to squirm off into the cane.
Baderoon was on him like a flash, and,
grabbing the tail, he snapped him against
the tree again. Nicky, prancing down from
the veranda, dashed in and fumbled at the
writhing coils, to try it himself; but with
a quick twist the powerful tail fastened
itself around his ankle, and a huge, thick
loop of the snake rose and curled itself tight
around his waist. The boy gasped, crushed
breathless, and it looked serious for a time
as Dwight and the curator rushed down to
the rescue, but suddenly there was a bright
flash of steel, and Sadok’s parang met the
next loop coming down over the boy’s head
and clove it nearly in two.</p>

<p>“Me sorry, Orang-kaya,” said Sadok, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the snake collapsed and Nicky squirmed free
of the aimless coils. “Me spoil’m specimen?”</p>

<p>“You did just right, Sadok!” said the
curator, heartily. “He could have crushed
Nicky to death, even in his last throes—”</p>

<p>“Him plenty debbil-debbil!” interrupted
Baderoon, coming up from freeing Nicky.
“White boy nebber, <i>nebber</i> let snake-fellah
catch’m first! Mus’ run with him-a tailie—fast!”
he explained, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the curator, after the Fat
One had been guyed to everybody’s satisfaction,
“le’s go in for a look-see. Perhaps
some more interesting creatures are camping
out in our bungalow!”</p>

<p>They explored every nook and cranny of
the hut, dislodging a few kangaroo mice,
which were captured and added to the collections
after hilarious chases, but no larger
visitors were found, and no poisonous snakes,
rare throughout the archipelago, were discovered.
The curator set the lamp on a
table out on the veranda, after supper, and
they sat around it, collecting the rare moths
and beetles attracted by its light. As a
nightcap, the brilliant and wonderful clear-winged
moth came fluttering in, and the
curator snatched at it avidly with his net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“<i>Cocytia d’urviller!</i>” he gasped, taking
the gorgeous prize from the net. “Boys,
we are in luck! There are not five of these
in all the museums of America! I guess
that will be about all for to-night!”</p>

<p>The party turned in, and long before dawn
were awakened by the native hunter at the
veranda steps. Gulping some hot coffee and
downing a rasher of bacon and eggs, they
slung on their knapsacks, grabbed their guns,
and followed him to the boat for a trip to
the mainland in the mighty jungles of Aru,
where dwelt the great bird of paradise.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br>

<small>INTO THE JUNGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE jungle of the mainland of Aru came
down to the very water’s edge. A narrow
strip of sandy beach, lined with nodding
palms, was strewn with fallen trees, bare and
sun dried, and whole colonies of hermit crabs
on the beach told of the teeming life of tropical
nature pushed to the very verge of the
sea. Their party landed from the village
key of old coral growth, and stepped ashore
at the end of a native path that was a mere
tunnel through the undergrowth. Never
had they seen palms in such profusion or
so tall and magnificent, the bare trunks
rising through lesser growths a hundred
feet high, where the great fronds of leaves
spread green umbrellas far overhead. The
tree ferns, their first in this Papuan land,
rose feathery and beautiful, with stems thirty
feet high, above which shot up the lacy
fronds, giant replicas of our northern hot-house
varieties. The ubiquitous banana was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
everywhere, growing wild in the forest, generally
in the open glades of pandanus palms,
whose scraggly trees twisted high in the
misty air, with spikes of leaves like century
plants at their branch tips. And every now
and then, through the dim vistas of vine
and creeper, they could note a dense thicket
where a giant fig tree grew, surrounded by
its own forest of aërial root shoots a hundred
feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Down on the jungle floor scuttled millions
of silent hermit crabs, or great orange-and-red
land crabs popped down their holes.
One had but to look an instant to realize
that the jungle was alive with lizards, black,
green, and gray, all motionless on limb or
root, staring at the explorers with bright
beady eyes—to flash into a green streak of
movement at the first motion to catch them.</p>

<p>It was early, with the faint light of dawn
hardly penetrating the green depths all about
them as they went silently along in single
file, listening to the chorus of bird life in
the tree tops. The shrill scream of lories
and parakeets, the hoarse cry of the tree
pigeons, and the incessant chirrup of smaller
birds awoke the jungle with the voices of
the bird world. Then the sun shot up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
a flaming fire into the pale tropical heavens,
and its rays lit up the glades, showing huge
yellow-and-black spiders on thick ropy webs
swung in every open spot, and gorgeous
butterflies in metallic blues and greens sailing
through the sunlit vistas, causing many
a stop and chase.</p>

<p>A cry rang startlingly through the tree
tops. “Wawk! Wawk! Wawk!—Wok, wok
wok!” it said, remarkably like the caw of
our northern crow.</p>

<p>The curator stopped and listened, his
hand to ear to locate the direction of the
sound. “The great bird of paradise, boys!”
he exclaimed, exultingly.</p>

<p>“Why, it sounds exactly like a crow flying
through our home woods!” cried Dwight.</p>

<p>“Sure! It’s the tropical crow. They all
belong to the crow family, only this is what
Nature can do with the crow when you give
her plenty of heat and sunlight!” retorted
the curator. “There he goes again, off to
the left!”</p>

<p>“Him go-stop sacaléli tree,” put in Sadok,
who had been listening, fumbling at the
cover of his dart quiver.</p>

<p>“Yes? The sacaléli, the plumage dance,”
agreed the curator. “They meet in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
large tree, where the males dance and show
off their plumes before the females. Baderoon,
ask’m hunter-fellah if we go catch’m
sacaléli tree, all right,” he said, turning to
the negro.</p>

<p>There were a few grunts between the
Papuan and the Aru hunter, who nodded
stolidly and led on. The party quickened
their pace as the path led upward through
the hills. Then Sadok stopped and raised
his long ironwood sumpitan. It poised for
an instant, pointing up into a wide-branched
bamboo clump, and, before their eyes could
pick out the mark, came the soft plop! of
the dart as it left the sumpitan like a streak
of light. Followed the fall of a reddish
bird, tumbling down through the leaves,
and Baderoon dashed into the thicket to
retrieve it. He brought back a jewel of
fluttering fire in his hands. Of an intense
metallic red, its throat was of deep orange,
and from under the wings jutted out two
little fronds of gray aigrettes tipped with
broad bands of lustrous metallic green.</p>

<p>“The king bird of paradise!” cried the
curator, holding the feathered beauty in his
hands and examining it admiringly. “Great
business, Sadok! What a wonderful bird!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Rare, too, isn’t it?” asked Dwight.</p>

<p>“You’re dead right it is! We’ll be lucky
if we get two of them this expedition!” said
the curator.</p>

<p>Just then Nicky, who had come back
from a foray with his hands full of lizards
and crabs, had a flash of inspiration. “Put
him on a twig, quick!” he yelled. “I’ll get
a colored photo of him!”</p>

<p>“Good idea, kid!” smiled the curator.
“That will be something new.”</p>

<p>The bird was alive yet, only partly paralyzed
by the poison, and his eyes were
bright and open, and the little tufts on his
breast still erect. He sat quietly on a twig
in the sunlight, while Nicky set up a folding
steel tripod and took three color plates
as fast as he could change holders.</p>

<p>“That’ll be about worth the whole trip
to me!” he cried. “Wait till the director
of the Museum sees that print, eh, Mr.
Baldwin?” he chuckled.</p>

<p>The curator grinned indulgently. He
loved Nick’s intense enthusiasms, particularly
when they led to something of scientific
value. Sadok wrapped the prize
carefully in a cone of pandanus leaf and they
started out again. After about an hour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
travel they came to a high plateau where
the creepers and hanging vines were less
abundant and one could see for some distance
under the forest floor. A grove of
tall tree trunks loomed up ahead, with bare,
scant-leaved branches. Each had a sort of
leaf hut, built far up in the fork.</p>

<p>They skirted the grove, silently, the curator
explaining how the native hunters secured
paradise birds by lying in wait for them
under the hut, aiming with a blunt-headed
arrow at the males during the dance. Their
own hunter paid no attention to the grove,
but led on for a mile farther across the plateau.
Then he stopped and pointed up into
the trees. Here was a similar grove, but much
smaller, and buried far deeper in the jungle.
Evidently it was his own secret hunting ground.
Grunting a few words to Baderoon, he undid
the belt of woven fiber about his waist and
made a loop of it around the tree. Then,
alternately walking up it and shifting the belt,
he ascended the bare trunk to the leaf screen
built in its fork, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“Him stop, go-shoot’m goby-goby,” explained
Baderoon in a stage whisper. “We-fellah
go-hide and catch’m spec’men when
he drop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>They all sought hiding places in the underbrush
and waited. After a time came a
distant, “Wawk! Wawk! Wawk!” answered
by another bird farther off in the jungle,
and then by still another. Like a flock of
crows calling to the assembly, the boys
could hear the paradise birds gathering.
Then, like a flash of shimmering light, a
great golden bird, eighteen inches long, came
dropping down from over the tree tops. He
lit in the tree farthest off from the hunter’s,
preened himself awhile, and then lifted up
his voice in the call of his kind. An answering
cry heralded the approach of another
one, and soon he too dropped down and
joined the other.</p>

<p>“That’s bad—they’re gathering in the
wrong tree,” whispered Nicky to Dwight,
who lay by his side.</p>

<p>“Wait,” cautioned his chum. “We can
shoot and get a few, if worse comes to worst.
I’d far rather get a nest or an egg. There’s
not one in any museum in the world, the
curator tells me. Look—there’s a female!”</p>

<p>Nicky looked up to see a dull, coffee-colored
bird perch down quietly on a near-by
branch. The two males at once began to
ruffle and preen their long golden plumes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Peering through his glasses, Dwight could
even see the pale-blue beak, the delicate
straw yellow of head and neck, and the
rich, scaly feathers of metallic emerald green
on the throat. From under the wings came
the long two-foot plumes of intense glossy
orange-brown color, and they ruffled and
spread in the breeze as the male bird shook
them for the admiration of the female. A
glorified crow, a crow raised to the most
unimaginable hues of bottled sunlight and
all the vivid splendor of the tropics, was
the great bird of paradise! As Dwight looked,
he began to dance, hopping up and down
on the limb, each motion spreading the
glorious plumes and letting them fall like
down. His rival was dancing also, and
three more males and another female joined
them.</p>

<p>Dwight crawled over to the curator, who
was watching the whole performance avidly
through his glasses.</p>

<p>“Our native hunter’s out of luck, sir!”
he muttered. “He’ll never be able to hit
them from his tree, and if he misses one the
whole flock will fly off. What’ll we do—shoot?”</p>

<p>“Presently,” whispered the curator. “Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
get Nicky, and we’ll each pick a bird and
fire. They may fly over to the hunter’s tree
yet, but I can see that they’re all as suspicious
as our own crows. The tree they
are in seems to suit them all right.”</p>

<p>Another male flew in as he spoke, and the
whole tree top was filled with hopping,
flashing flames of golden color, a sight in
itself that was worth traveling many miles
to see. Dwight soon returned, with Nicky
crawling behind him, and the three lay and
watched the birds, far overhead.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, I guess we’d better fire,”
said the curator, at length. “That native
may try to shoot from his tree and spoil the
whole thing. Dwight, you pick a female,
and Nicky and I will each get one of the
males, and then we’ll do what we can with
the other barrel.”</p>

<p>They raised their guns and were about
to shoot, when one of the male birds silently
loosed his hold and came tumbling down!</p>

<p>“Wait! Sadok!” whispered the curator,
restraining them energetically. “I’d quite
forgotten about him and his sumpitan!”
Another bird fell. Somewhere, deep in the
jungle, that silent, deadly blowgun in Sadok’s
hands was bringing them down. At long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
intervals two more birds fell, and then there
was a slight <i>tock!</i> in the branches and they
could see through the glasses the short dart
sticking in the bark. The other birds raised
alarmed cries at it and prepared to fly.</p>

<p>“Now!” cried the curator. “Get a couple
of females!” The guns barked as the startled
birds took wing, while two dull-colored hen
birds and another male came tumbling down.
Then they all rushed over to pick up the
specimens.</p>

<p>The native hunter came dropping hurriedly
down out of his tree, gave them one
wild look of terror, and bolted incontinently
into the forest, shrieking an unintelligible
gibberish as he ran. Baderoon burst into a
yell of laughter and tumbled on the ground
with merriment.</p>

<p>“Now <i>what</i> in the dickens ails <i>him</i>?”
grinned the curator, looking after the flying
native from the bird in his hand. “Call
him back, Baderoon.”</p>

<p>“Taboo! <i>Yow-yowri!</i> Bewitched! Debbil-debbil!”
gasped Baderoon from the ground.
“Him see plenty debbil-debbil! Bird, he
go-dead—no see um arrow, no hear gun!
Him no come back!” he cackled, squirming
in an agony of mirth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Get up, fool! Go catch’m!” ordered
the curator, sternly, kicking the helpless
negro to his feet. Baderoon ran off, still
howling with delight.</p>

<p>“He’ll never catch that coon in ten thousand
years!” chuckled Nicky. “Sadok’s
blowgun scared all the hair off his head.
But—how are we going to get out of the
jungle without him, though?”</p>

<p>“We’ll camp right here,” declared the
curator. “It’s always home wherever we
are, and there’s lots to do.”</p>

<p>“All right, and, as I have no camp to
make, I’m going to find a nest or an egg if
it takes all day!” declared Nicky. “I
haven’t really begun to study this jungle
yet, you know!”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” agreed the curator,
heartily. “Take Sadok along with you, so
that you’ll turn up sometime,” he laughed.
“Dwight and I will make camp and skin
out the birds.”</p>

<p>The grove was an excellent one to camp
in, clear and open under the great trees, and
Dwight started his camp at once. Their
system was an original and elastic one, each
man for himself, each one eating or sleeping
when and where he pleased. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
long ago discarded the old-fashioned camp
where one man cooked for the crowd and
all had to be in at mealtimes. Such a system
was too rigid and conventional for such
diverse tastes and occupations as these three.</p>

<p>Dwight opened his pack and unlimbered
his steel pickax, driving down into the lava
rock with its point to make holes for tent
pegs and clear out rocks on his sleeping site.
He chose a spot covered with small bushes
like huckleberries, filled with a windfall of
dried leaves. Here he spread out his sleeping
bag, and over it went a light tent fly,
on a rope stretched over two forked stakes.
From the rope he hung a mosquito screen,
with a small ring of cane cut in the jungle
and bent into a hoop a foot in diameter, so
as to hold the net gauze clear of his face.
This hoop was tied inside the square of net
about a foot below the central peak from
which it hung, and the folds of the net draped
over the head of the bag. Dwight’s sleeping
bag was waterproof and insectproof, so
that, with the net hung over his face and
the fly over that, forming a sun and rain
shade, he was well protected from insects
and wet weather on very little weight—about
five pounds all told for tent and bedding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>In front of his camp the lad built a small
stone fireplace, with a row of his little food
sacks hung handy around it on cross poles.
He set about making a batter of flour, corn
meal, dried egg powder, dried milk, and
baking powder, and soon had cooked himself
a pile of flapjacks. With the body of a
paradise bird grilling on a forked stick, and
a tin of tea steeping on the hearth, he was
as well fed and comfortable as anywhere
else in the world. After lunch he seized
his pickax and went collecting for insects
and beetles in the forest, the sharp pick
point digging and prying into the bark of
prone trees, where many a new form of
jewel-bodied tropical beetle came to his
collection box.</p>

<p>The curator had silently melted into the
jungle, whence soon appeared the brown
glint of sunlight from the tent fly spread
over his hammock. A great bag of netting
enveloped the latter, and it could be drawn
in tight by a string after he had gotten
inside. A handful of rockahominy washed
down with a drink from his canteen and a
bite of grilled bird satisfied him for lunch.
After skinning out the paradise birds and
hanging them in a row from a line stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
between two trees to keep them from the
ants, he disappeared into the jungle on his
favorite occupation of studying bird life.</p>

<p>Dwight found a bewildering world of new
entomology awaiting him. His pickax, net,
and magnifying glass were busy every moment,
and the boy quivered with excitement, rushing
hither and yon through the jungle, now
after a leaf-winged butterfly, which would
disappear with maddening legerdemain; now
stooping to watch a fight between two male
<i>Brenthidæ</i>, long armored beetles with fighting
jaws at the end of a slender proboscis
like a spear; now urged to frantic pursuit
of the rare horned deer fly. The mystery
of the leaf-winged butterfly was solved when
he had examined a bush on which it lit more
closely. One of the leaves turned out to
be the creature itself, with wings folded,
motionless on the stem, the under surface
of its wings so closely resembling the leaves
that only the closest scrutiny could detect
the difference.</p>

<p>By late afternoon he returned to camp
by compass, his box full of new and wonderful
insects.</p>

<p>“Look at the day’s plunder, Mr. Baldwin!”
cried the youth, enthusiastically. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
drew out the cork slabs from his carrying
tin, covered with the heterogenous collection
impaled on pins.</p>

<p>“These horned flies are a real find!”
exclaimed the curator, interestedly, after
examining the butterflies and beetles. “They
go to prove a great scientific fact—first
propounded as a theory by Mr. Wallace,
the English naturalist—that Aru was once
part of New Guinea. Those little flies can
be explained in no other way. Common
in New Guinea, it would be impossible for
them to travel the hundred and fifty miles
from the New Guinea coast to Aru. To-morrow,
if Nicky does not come back, we’ll
go on a trip to see another curious phenomenon,
the salt-water channels that divide
the islands of Aru. They are true rivers,
yet have no flow other than the tide at their
mouths. How do you explain that, Dwight?”</p>

<p>The boy confessed that he could not.
“Come to think of it, sir, these are the only
islands in the world that <i>have</i> such channels,”
he cried out over the novelty of it.</p>

<p>As Nicky did not put in an appearance
that night, they set out next morning northward,
leaving Baderoon to skin out birds
in camp. The curator did not worry over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Nicky. In his rucksack the lad had carried
his odd nightgear, of an old bathing suit
with the armholes sewed up to pull over his
bed, a pair of extra socks to cover his arms
and another for his feet. So dressing up
to go to bed, Nicky would turn in on a leaf
patch, secure from insects and snakes, and,
with Sadok to guide him, would be abundantly
able to care for himself.</p>

<p>After several hours’ travel to the north
the going became more rocky and the vegetation
sparse and thorny. Soon open skyline
appeared ahead, and then they came
upon the rocky cliffs of basic limestone that
border the south bank of the river Majkor,
which separates the Aru mainlands of Maykor
and Kobror. The north bank was high
jungle, and up and down its reaches it was
a true river, a deep, narrow channel winding
through the jungle as far as the eye
could reach. Yet its waters were salt.</p>

<p>“That’s really wonderful, sir!” cried
Dwight, enthusiastically, when he had
grasped the full significance of it. “Lots
of small islands like England, for instance,
have rivers; but they are true rivers, rising
in the mountains somewhere. Others have
salt straits dividing them from the mainland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
like Staten Island, at home. This
channel can’t be a fissure, for it winds and
turns just like a river. What is Wallace’s
theory, Mr. Baldwin?” he asked, giving it up.</p>

<p>“The true one, I think,” replied the
curator. “The west coast of Aru is deep
water; the east, a shallow pearl sea, clear
over to New Guinea. That sea was undoubtedly
formed by gradual subsidence of the
sea bottom. It is only three hundred feet
deep; so that would not take long for geology
to accomplish. The coast of New Jersey is
rising two feet a century. At no very distant
date, then, New Guinea and Aru were
one big continent, with all the sea between
lowlands—very like those that extend now
back from the coast to the Great Precipice
over where we are soon going. The rivers,
then, like the Outanata and the Mimika,
must have flowed through those lowlands,
and these channels of Aru were part of
them, emptying into the sea on the west
coast of Aru. Can’t you see how important
this little trip of ours is, now? This river
can tell us something of the mineralogy of
the unexplored interior of New Guinea! And
without our ever going there, for that matter!”</p>

<p>“Sure it can—if we had a long line and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
grappling hook to dredge with!” said Dwight,
practically.</p>

<p>“We have the former!” smiled the curator,
producing out of his rucksack a hank of
strong green Banks line, “and we’ll make
a grappling.”</p>

<p>Near by grew a tree of the Erythina family,
its profuse scarlet blossoms a grand note
of color against the gray cliffs. Thousands
of swallows swooped about the latter, and
the curator eyed them absorbedly.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he exclaimed. “Dwight, you cut
a length from that Erythina, with a whorl
of branches at one end, and make a grappling,
while I go on a look-see.”</p>

<p>Dwight drew his pickax and fashioned a
wooden grappling hook with its keen hatchet
blade. When he got through the curator
had returned from the cliffs, bearing a gelatinous
bird nest.</p>

<p>“Here is the edible bird nest of China!”
he exclaimed. “I heard that they got them
on Aru, as well as in the cliff caves of Borneo.
These banks must be the Aru collecting
ground. Ever eat one?”</p>

<p>“No!” shuddered Dwight.</p>

<p>“Not half bad. We’ll have this one for dessert,
to-day. And now le’s see that grappling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>He bound on the end of the cod line, and
they found a dead trunk which would form
a tolerable raft. Dropping the grappling,
with a heavy stone lashed to it, they waited
for a short drift, paying out line, and then
began to haul. It soon struck something
solid. Pulling it in, a great frond of fan
coral came to the surface, and attached to
its roots was the stone it grew on. The
curator cleaned it and examined its structure
avidly.</p>

<p>“First news of New Guinea!” he chuckled.
“This stone formed part of the river drift,
long ago. It is—<i>slate</i>!” he barked, joyously.
“And here is a small bit of fossil
on one surface. See it? That means coal
measures! It confirms my idea that an
island three hundred miles wide and fourteen
hundred miles long <i>can’t</i> be all volcanic,
or all coral! There <i>must</i> be stratified,
geological formations in the interior, coal
measures, iron ore—all that civilization needs.
Try again!”</p>

<p>The next two casts brought up sea ferns,
with more chunks of limestone and slate,
but the third gave them a yellowish, heavy
stone, sandy and streaked with brown.</p>

<p>“Ore! Iron ore!” yelled the curator, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
even the mud was washed off it. “Regular
li’l’ scientific expedition of our own, eh,
Dwight!”</p>

<p>The boy took the next cast. He brought
up a heavy, reddish stone that the curator
examined with the greatest interest. “That’s
cinnabar, red oxide of mercury, unless I
miss my guess. It <i>may</i> be red iron ore, but
seems too crystalline for that. We’ll keep
this, Dwight, until I can get back to the
bungalow and make some chemical tests.”</p>

<p>“Is it valuable?” asked the boy, curiously.</p>

<p>“Very!” replied the curator, abstractedly.
He was off on one of his mental explorations—explorer’s
dreams for the future welfare
of the world that come to him who opens
up new territory for mankind. His very
silence awakened a strange presentment of
wonders to come in the boy’s mind. Gee!
it was great to delve into the world’s secrets,
where no white man had ever been before!
He longed for the time for the New Guinea
trip to come. A few days more on Aru,
and then—into a wild and dangerous country,
in search of new discoveries that might prove
of the greatest value to the civilized world.
It was wonderful to be part of this expedition!</p>

<small>PIRATE VISITATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEANWHILE Nicky and Sadok had
been exploring into the untracked
jungle to the southward. The low hills of
Aru grew more rocky, and the rank jungle
gave way to sparse open growth, with rocky
soil and wild grass swales here and there.
It was hot, out here in the sun, and their
canteens were in frequent use. Presently a
wild brush turkey jumped from cover and
ran cackling and gobbling through the bush
growth. He went like a deer, as Nicky
whipped out the Officer’s Colt and fired on
the run. At the same time Sadok’s sumpitan
coughed and its dart flashed across the
grass tops.</p>

<p>“Doubled!” shouted Nicky, as the turkey
tumbled and lay kicking stiffly. They ran
out to retrieve it. Only the dart of the
sumpitan stuck in its side.</p>

<p>“Missed, by hookey!” laughed Nicky at
himself. “Judged by Dyak standards, I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
a mere swine, I suppose. Eh, Sadok? Say,
what poison are you using now?” he exclaimed
suddenly. “That turkey fell over like a
shot. The upas-tree stuff takes some time—three
hours for a man, they tell me.”</p>

<p>Sadok held up the little pot of bamboo for
him to smell. “Upas <i>vine, Orang-kichil</i>”
(little chief), he explained. “Him different
tree. Red bark. Ver’ quick!”</p>

<p>“Smells like strychnia to me,” said the
boy, wonderingly. “Beats all how nature
has provided a specimen of that family of
trees all over the tropics throughout the
world. India, the nux vomica; South America,
the wourali; here, some new one that I
don’t know. I’ll ask the curator some day.”</p>

<p>They broiled two great steaks from the
breast of the turkey for the midday meal, for
the poison from the darts does not reduce the
edibility at all, and Sadok stowed the legs for
further food. After the lunch they set out
in a generally southeasterly direction, as
Nicky knew it would bring them at length
to another of those odd channels that divide
Aru, and he wanted to see something of
Vorkai, the southernmost island. A large
screw pine came in sight. Its almost bare
branches twisted high into the bright sunlight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and the spikes of daggerlike leaves
growing in clusters at the branch tips drew
an exclamation of pleasure from Sadok, for
he was nearly out of pandanus leaf to wrap
“spec’mens” in. They went over to it.</p>

<p>“Hi!” called Nicky. “Look who’s here!”</p>

<p>A large brown animal was climbing around
up near the tops.</p>

<p>“Tree kangaroo. Get him! The curator
will want one!” cried the boy, drawing his
revolver. He aimed carefully, and at the
report the animal flinched, but seemed to
maintain its hold in the branches. He fired
again, with the same result. The tree kangaroo
now moved sluggishly toward another
branch.</p>

<p>“Shoot, Sadok! I <i>must</i> have hit him, but
he sure can carry a lot of lead!”</p>

<p>Sadok raised the blowgun to his lips and
held his cupped fist over his mouth. Filling
his lungs, he blew a full breath. The dart
soared up into the tree top and they saw it
sticking from the animal’s side. Presently
his limbs grew limp and he partly fell, but
his long, hooked claws caught in the branches
and hung. He made no further move.</p>

<p>“Dead as a mackerel, but I’ll have to
swarm up after him!” declared Nicky, emphatically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
He was a fearless climber, and he
shinned the trunk and was soon in the
branches. Worming up one of them, he
reached the tree kangaroo. It was like its
cousins, the wallaby of New Guinea and
the great gray kangaroo of Australia, but
with heavy, coarse fur and long, hooked
claws especially adapted to climbing.</p>

<p>“Hit him both times, myself,” he called
down: “Gorry! but he’s tenacious of life!”
He detached the animal from its hold and
dropped it down. It weighed some sixty
pounds. They were an hour skinning it,
after which Sadok put away some of the
choicest meat, for he never let an opportunity
for food go by in the jungle.</p>

<p>Then Nicky spied a great blue butterfly,
the <i>Papilio ulysses</i>, soaring through the tops
of the screw pine overhead. They set off
in hot pursuit, with the skin of the kangaroo
hanging to his belt.</p>

<p>“Dwight will want this fellow!” urged
Nicky, stumbling through thickets and over
stony and coralline ground. Hermit crabs
scuttled out of their way in the underbrush;
lizards of every shade streaked across under
their feet, but still the lad kept his eyes on
that magnificent prize which persistently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
flew high. At length it came down and
alighted on a moist spot in the earth, evidently
thirsty. He crept up and dropped
his helmet over the great metallic-blue beauty.</p>

<p>“Hooray! What a prize for Dwight! How
in thunder am I ever going to carry it, though?”
He started to pin it to his helmet, but Sadok
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Him all tore, in bushes,” he objected.
“Me show’m.” Searching the jungle awhile,
he presently came back with a broad, flat
cactus leaf which he was busily paring of
thorns as he walked. Then he slit it open
with his kriss and gouged out a recess for the
body of the butterfly in its pulpy interior.
Lining it with flat pieces of pandanus, he
was ready for <i>Papilio ulysses</i>, who was forthwith
spread out, flat winged, and then securely
bound in his green prison with thongs of rattan.</p>

<p>“Some sandwich!” grinned Nicky as it
was slipped into the map pocket of his rucksack.
“Worth about fifty dollars just as it
stands! Won’t I have some fun with old
Dwight, with it, though!”</p>

<p>They abandoned collecting for the time,
as the canteens were running low and water
was getting to be a problem unless they expected
to live on what could be poured from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the air plants that grew profusely in the dry
jungle. A small ravine running downhill
looked promising, and they climbed down
into it. After half a mile it grew swampy,
and soon a small, clear stream of fresh water
developed. They were filling the canteens
at the nearest hollow when voices came
through the jungle, the chatter of a child
and the deep cackle of an old man, both
speaking Papuan. Sadok and Nicky waited.
Presently both appeared, coming down to the
brook. The man was an almost naked, mop-haired
Aru native, carrying a bow and quiver;
the pickaninny wore only a string around
his fat middle, and had a tiny bow in his
hands. Both jumped and dashed back into
the jungle, with grunts and squeals of fear,
at sight of Nicky.</p>

<p>The latter laughed and called after them
reassuringly. Presently the pickaninny appeared,
climbing a sapling trunk like a
small tree frog. He stopped, peering around
the trunk at them curiously, his feet dug
into the bark with bunched-up toes, his sinewy
little hands wound around the trunk, while
his inquisitive face looked at them with a
half-fearful expression.</p>

<p>Nicky smiled at him and dug into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
pockets. He fished out a small bag of beads
and held out a few of the sparkling trinkets
in his palm. The youngster’s eyes snapped.
They could see the old man peering at them
through the underbrush, arrow on bow,
afraid to come out at all.</p>

<p>Nicky beckoned to the boy and motioned
to give him some. He finally descended the
tree, and with many advances and retreats
ventured out to clutch the beads in his small
paw. Then he dashed back into the jungle,
where a childish yell and the sound of a slap
told that the old man had seized him and
rifled him of his beads.</p>

<p>Nicky called out the pickaninny and gave
him more. Then the old man poked his
head out, and Sadok spoke to him in Malay.
He knew that tongue enough to talk, and
presently they were exchanging news. With
much coaxing he was finally got out where
Nicky could pour him quite a handful of
the green, blue, red, and yellow trinkets.
Much impressed, he jerked his thumb over
shoulder and invited them to visit their
village, which, he said, lay a short distance on.</p>

<p>They followed up what appeared to be
something of a trail, and soon the jungle
cleared and a blue arm of the sea lay before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
them, with a large island offshore. Nicky
took it to be Varkai, but his attention was
soon called to the village itself. It was of
two palm huts, built on piles about seven
feet above the ground, and the place was
crowded with natives, most of whom gave
one astonished look at Nicky and then bolted
for the jungle.</p>

<p>The old man called them back, and presently
the <i>orang-kaya</i>, or chief, came toward
him, holding out his hand for more beads.
It was not long before Nicky was the center
of an excited throng of chattering Papuans,
who fingered his clothing and pranced around
him with characteristic native merriment.
Nicky was a whole circus in himself, he began
to appreciate. Men, women, and children
never seemed to tire of standing and gazing
at him, after which they would usually do a
somersault or roll on the ground with explosions
of boisterous laughter. To them he
and his clothes were the funniest thing they
had ever looked at.</p>

<p>As it was growing late, Sadok arranged
for a night’s lodgings. A space about ten
by twenty feet at the end of one of the huts
was cleared off and turned over to their use.
Here they laid down their few belongings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
and sat down on mats to watch the strange
life around them. A clay floor behind a
partition served for a fireplace, where Sadok
set about cooking the kangaroo meat. The
rest of the hut was jammed with natives
talking and laughing incessantly, only ceasing
when their eyes were fully occupied in
staring at him.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all, a yell, “<i>Bajak!
Bajak!</i>” (“Pirates! Pirates!”) arose, and
everyone tumbled out of the hut and poured
down to the beach. Great guard fires piled
up along shore were lit, and their lurid glare
lighted up the whole scene; the proas of the
natives hauled up on the beach, the warriors
dancing along the shore, brandishing their
bows and spears and yelling defiance, and
the two huts back a short distance, with the
black wall of the jungle behind them, made
a wild picture that long remained vivid in
Nicky’s memory.</p>

<p>Nicky and Sadok had come down, eager
to be in the fray, and it seemed to the boy
that never had he been in so savage a spot
on the earth as in this forgotten corner of
Aru, with native warriors around him and a
pirate ship from the New Guinea coast somewhere
out there on the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Presently he made her out a long double
proa, or catamaran, with one big lateen
sail; a small lakatoi, with at least fifty warriors
in her, the <i>orang-kaya</i> told him. She
came on swiftly, under both paddles and
sails, and, when some fifty yards off the beach,
opened fire with the flash and bang of Singapore
muskets loaded with black powder.</p>

<p>Bows twanged all about Nicky, javelins
flew through the air, Sadok’s sumpitan
coughed. Some of the younger warriors
turned to run at the sound of gunfire, but
the older men held steady, for their homes
and ships would be plundered if defeated.
Nicky drew his revolver and opened fire in
return. The heavy thunder of its .38 special
cartridges, close at hand, made all the warriors
near him jump and run, but the fact of
six flashes along shore and the execution it
evidently did among the pirates caused them
to stop paddling and haul in sheet as the
lakatoi swung around.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Sadok, launch one of those
proas and after ’em and we’ll have ’em on
the run!” barked Nicky, seizing the psychological
moment to attack. Sadok called on
the <i>orang-kaya</i>, and he and a dozen warriors
sprang to the nearest proa and launched her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Nicky reloading swiftly. As she put out
for the pirate lakatoi he opened up with a
second burst of pistol shots. The pirate
was now making all sail out to sea, the few
flashes from her native muskets showing
that most of her crew were paddling hard
away from them. Presently her mat sail
came down and she paddled into the eye of
the wind, where their own proa could not
follow. Nicky shot a third burst after them
as the range widened out of bow shot.</p>

<p>“Gee! the curator told me that New
Guinea pirates still attacked the villages in
the wilder part of Aru, but I couldn’t have
believed it!” he muttered to himself. “Now
I’ve been in it—and we drove them off!
Must be a fine country we’re going to, what
Sadok!”</p>

<p>“Plenty bad mans ober dere!” agreed
Sadok. “Mus’ shoot all time.”</p>

<p>They picked up a few dead men out of the
dark waters. Hideously streaked with white
clay, they wore long white boars’ tusks
through their noses, and had a peculiar breast
guard, made of rows of boars’ tusks one above
the other, woven in a kind of net of palm-fiber.
A keen, flat bamboo knife floating in the water
gave Nicky a clew as to the tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Tugeri!” he exclaimed. “Head hunters.
They were after heads and loot, Sadok! A
sudden attack and a quick getaway is their
style. Last year they appeared suddenly
inside the barbed wire of the Dutch fort at
Merauke and decapitated six Javanese and
got away before the garrison could get out
after them. We’ll have a time, with either
them or the Outanatas!”</p>

<p>The proa returned to shore amid the shouts
and rejoicings of all the village capering
about the beach. Nicky and Sadok, utterly
weary, retired to their portion of the hut to
sleep, after the first burst of enthusiasm had
died down. But the natives made an all-night
orgy of it. Nicky put on his bathing
suit headgear and his night socks over his
arms and wrists, and turned in on a palm-fiber
mat, while mosquitoes hummed about
him and the noise and shouting and laughter
on shore dulled away in his drowsy ears.</p>

<p>Next day they bade good-by to the chief.
He had a present to make, it seemed, in
return for the white man’s services in repelling
their visitors of the night before. Out of a
fetish bag, that held evidently the treasures
of the entire village, he took a parcel carefully
wrapped in cotton. Unwinding it, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
drew out the skin of a bird of more than
ordinary interest. Reverently he unwrapped
the last of its bindings, and handed it to
Nicky with a smile of grateful pleasure.</p>

<p>“Gorry!” muttered the boy, as he received
the present before the whole tribe. “If I’m
not wrong, that’s the rarest of the rare—the
magnificent bird of paradise! Won’t the
curator be tickled, though!”</p>

<p>It was a small bird, but brilliant in the
extreme of plumage. The head was covered
with small, brown, velvety feathers, but
back of its neck arose a fan-shaped ruffle of
the most brilliant yellow, backed by a second
fan of intense metallic orange. The whole
of the breast was rich, deep green, in changeable
hues of peacock and purple. The tail
was formed of two curved plumes of delicate
metallic brown, which curved in airy spirals—a
feathered gem as rich in coloring as the
vividest-hued humming bird, but far larger.</p>

<p>“The only one!” managed the chief, in
Malay, as Nicky bowed his thanks.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is! But two have been found
in all New Guinea. This is the first reported
from Aru. Had it long, Chief?”</p>

<p>“Many years. No more. White man
welcome!” grinned the old fellow, gratefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>They bade them all good-by and set out
by compass for the neighborhood of camp.
How to find it was something of a poser, but
after a morning’s march the lay of the hills
began to seem familiar once more and Sadok
led them in to the very jungle of tall trees
where they had first seen the great birds of
paradise.</p>

<p>Dwight was in camp, and overjoyed at
Nicky’s present of the <i>Papilio ulysses</i>, which
was so rare a treasure that he at once set
about pouring a plaster-of-Paris mold for
it and getting it under glass without delay.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a trade-last for you, old
scout,” said Dwight as he mounted the specimen,
“but I haven’t. The curator and I
have been mineralogizing since you were gone.
We found out a lot about the interior of New
Guinea—”</p>

<p>“New Guinea!” echoed Nicky, amazedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, New Guinea,” retorted Dwight,
and he told Nicky of the source of the channels
that divide Aru.</p>

<p>“And didn’t you get a single sea snake,
down there?” asked Nicky, regretfully. “The
shallow sea’s full of ’em, all highly venomous,
you know—”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” shivered Dwight, recalling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
hours they had spent unprotected on the
raft. “That’s more in your line. Real sea
serpents, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I still believe in the sea serpent,”
laughed Nicky. “There are plenty of small
ones among the New Guinea coasts and up
the lagoons. They have a broad, finny tail
like an eel, but are true serpents. They
swim up near the surface and live on fish,
but have poison fangs just like many of the
land snakes. That’s why I am still convinced
that there may be a larger species, sometimes
seen far at sea by ships. They have been too
often reported to be a myth. But these islands
are too dry and rocky for anything but lizards.
Where’s the curator gone?”</p>

<p>“He went after a black cockatoo which
came through the grove awhile ago. I heard
his gun recently.”</p>

<p>A little later the curator returned, carrying
a specimen of the great black cockatoo, a
rare find, but it was nothing to his delight
over the magnificent bird of paradise that
Nicky sprang on him unawares.</p>

<p>“Man dear, where did you get <i>that</i>!” he
yelled, examining it avidly. “That’s the
big prize of the expedition, so far. I guess
we can go on to New Guinea, now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>On the next day camp was broken and the
party steered out of the jungle by compass
and hunter’s paths, arriving back at the
bungalow by nightfall. The following two
days were mighty busy, for Nicky, as “snakeologist”
of the expedition, had a large assortment
of reptile skins to prepare, and the
curator, as ornithologist, likewise; and all
of them had to be packed in ant-proof tin
receptacles before leaving. Dwight, as entomologist,
mounted his specimens in flat,
glass-covered wooden boxes, which could be
packed a dozen at a time in tin cases.</p>

<p>That evening the curator hunted up the
captain and crew of the proa and they warped
her out into the harbor, for they were to
sail for New Guinea the next morning. They
all slept aboard once more, and at dawn
stood out of the coral reefs and headed around
Kobror for the hundred-mile run across to
the coast of Dutch New Guinea. Two mornings
after, the lofty chain of the Charles
Louis Mountains, as the northern end of the
Snow Mountains has been named, jutted out
of the sea under banks of clouds. Navigators
have measured the height of these mountains
at six to nine thousand feet, taking observations
from the decks of passing vessels, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the higher peaks of the Snow Mountains to
the south rise to sixteen thousand feet. The
mouths of a few rivers in that country have
been noted on the map; but the hinterland
remains a mystery to the world. Even the
South and North Poles are better known.</p>

<p>By afternoon, the mainland had become
quite visible, jungly foothills rising ridge on
ridge to the base of the Great Precipice,
which stretches south for two hundred miles,
the greatest precipice in the world. Above
it towered the snowy peaks far back in the
mainland. They came to realize how utterly
unknown and impenetrable it all is, when
they awoke next morning to find the proa
at anchor in a deep bay, with the jungly
mountains all around them and a lagoon
thirty miles long stretching back into the
hinterland. Mangrove swamps lined the
shore in an unbroken line. Here and there
a dent in them told of the mouth of a stream.
No living human was in sight, but the smoke
of signal fires rose from points along shore,
and scouting parties of native savages could
be made out through the glasses already
watching them, swinging through the trees
over the mangroves like troops of monkeys.
Now and then a long black canoe, with high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
carved prow, would cross the upper lagoon,
driven by lines of paddling blacks. The
very haste of them spelled danger, the passing
of the word through the villages that a
strange proa was here. A short raid on shore,
a few miles into the jungle at most, unless
attempted by a whole regiment of soldiers,
would be certain to end in ambush and murder.
As for those dense jungles and towering
mountains back a day’s march into the
interior—Unexplored! Danger! Pygmies!
Head hunters! was written all over them!</p>

<p>They were examining the shore curiously,
with a sense of the utter hopelessness of the
undertaking oppressing them, when a huge
black lakatoi, or native catamaran, jutted
its prow around the point of a cape to seaward.
Everyone turned to watch it, and
with chatterings and gesticulations the crew
sprang to life.</p>

<p>“Lakatoi, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!” sang out Sadok,
pointing to seaward. She towered like a
castle out of the sea. A single mast rose out
of her amidships, carrying one long triangular
mat sail with deeply incurved ends. Around
the mast was a wooden platform, a sort of
fighting deck with rails around it, and it was
held down on the two log canoes which floated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the structure by long bamboo arches like
the backs of a bridge. The lakatoi was
crowded with warriors whose spears and
bows and clubs could be made out jutting
up through the serried ranks like tiny black
jackstraws.</p>

<p>“<i>Bajak! Bajak!</i>” (“Pirates! Pirates!”) rose
the excited yell forward, and there was a mad
scramble of the crew to the waist for weapons.</p>

<p>“Every lakatoi full of natives is a ‘pirate’
to these beggars,” laughed the curator.
“They’ll probably prove hostile, though.
Look to your guns, boys.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to use the queer pistol,
sir?” asked Dwight, curiously, slipping a clip
of cartridges into the butt of his automatic.</p>

<p>“Nope. Won’t need to this time,” smiled
the curator. “Got to save it for something
worse!” He strolled to the deck house and
went inside.</p>

<p>Dwight and Nicky watched the lakatoi
bowling down toward them. The natives
on her were brandishing their bows and
spears and did not seem in the least friendly.
Their own crew now lined the rails of the
proa, armed with a motley collection of Singapore
muskets, old repeating rifles of the
Spencer vintage, and bows and arrows. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
yelled defiance at the approaching catamaran
and were evidently eager for a fight.</p>

<p>She came steadily on, while everyone
crouched behind the gunwales, peering at
her. At about fifty yards a cloud of arrows
sailed from her and came swishing and singing
aboard, striking the deck house and
sticking in the soft planks. Dwight picked
up one of them, while the thunder of black-powder
guns roared out from their own ship.
The arrow was of cane, without nock or
feathers, a yard long, and had a point of
ebony notched with barbs for a foot back.</p>

<p>“Outanatas!” he exclaimed. “They mean
business. Give it to ’em, Nick!” They fired
their pistols, hoping to add to the number
who had already dropped struggling on the
fighting platform. Sadok’s long sumpitan
stuck out over the gunwale, and at every
cough from its muzzle a yelling, arrow-shooting
native would grow livid and fall
helplessly among his comrades. Her deck
was a shambles, but there were plenty of
them left and she came steadily on.</p>

<p>A crash shivered the proa from stem to
stern as the lakatoi’s high prows rode up
over their gunwale, and twenty blacks leaped
aboard, stabbing with their spears over shields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
that were hideous with the carved scrolls of
diabolical faces on them. Parangs flashed
out among the crew and a fierce hand-to-hand
struggle on deck ensued. The crew
charged at the invaders, led by Sadok, whose
whirling parang-ihlang swung around his
head in red flashes that cleft to the bone
where they struck. The boys held off, firing
deliberately where a particularly fierce native
seemed to be carrying all before him. On
and on came the boarders in a living black
stream, while the air sang with arrows from
those still on the lakatoi. They were outnumbered,
three to one. Slowly the crew
gave back in the furious mêlée, the struggling
mass of brown and black men stabbing and
cutting in a writhing heap in the waist.
Behind them two tall natives fought toward
the masts, armed with blazing torches to set
the sail afire. With a fierce burst of pistol
shots the boys picked them off.</p>

<p>Then the brown flash of the curator’s long
frame leaped out of the deck house. An
arrow pierced his helmet as his arm swept
over his head in the cricketer’s swing. A
brown object like a baseball shot over to the
lakatoi, followed by another and another as the
arm went on swinging with incredible swiftness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span><i>Brr-aaam! Brr-aam! Brr-aam!</i> The detonation
was frightful, riving the lakatoi apart
in great splinters of logs and planks as the
grenades exploded. Men, sails, and spars
were torn apart in livid flashes of blinding
light. The concussion knocked down the
combatants on their own ship, while a giant,
foamy wave leaped out of the sea and engulfed
them, the water falling on the fighting men
in the waist like a deluge. Terror-stricken,
the boarders gave back, falling like flies
before the busy parangs, the survivors leaping
headlong into the sea. Of the lakatoi
there was nothing left but a mass of floating
fragments. In a moment more it was all over
and the crew stood breathing heavily, looking
at the curator with broad grins of delight.</p>

<p>“Welcome to New Guinea!” laughed the
curator, grimly, standing with a fourth hand
grenade in his grip, its firing mechanism still
unarmed. “I guess that will be about all,
Captain,” he said to the <i>jurugan</i>, who stood
nursing a cut shoulder. “Stop those fellows!”
he ordered, for the guns were beginning
to bark again at the survivors of the
lakatoi swimming in the water. “Let ’em
get ashore and tell all about it. Ought to
give us quite a rep! How did you make out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
boys?” he asked, turning to them coolly.
“This was nothing compared with some of
our trench parties.”</p>

<p>“Nice souvenir you’ve got, sir!” grinned
Nicky, pointing to the long arrow still sticking
in the curator’s helmet. “Dwight and
I got off easy. They didn’t seem to pay
much attention to us. Never saw a firearm
before, I suppose. A lot of the crew seem
dead or wounded, though, and I saw Baderoon
go down.”</p>

<p>“Get hold of Sadok, when you can,” ordered
the curator. “I see he’s busy in the
waist. And have them bring Baderoon into
the deck house.”</p>

<p>Some of the crew were now cleaning up
the waist and others were hoisting the anchor
by its primitive wooden windlass so as to
sail the proa farther up the lagoon. Sadok
came up, breathing happily through his wide
Malay nostrils.</p>

<p>“Me have’m lov’y fight, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!” he
beamed. “Catch’m three head!” He grinned,
holding up the gory trophies for them to
admire. “But you, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!” His eyes
looked adoringly at the curator. “White
man debbil-debbil verree strong! Him fight
like hell!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>

<small>NICK ENCOUNTERS A DEATH ADDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BADEROON was carried into the deck
house, his long, muscular Papuan frame
livid and limp. His rattan shield and bow
were borne by Sadok, but from his wrist still
dangled a long war club captured by him
during the fight. It was of stout ironwood,
with a head made of a thick disk of a stone
like jade. The club was ornamented with
rows of boars’ tusks dangling from its handle,
alternating with tufts of human hair, and a
stout strap held it to the wrist at its handle.
Dwight remembered having a glimpse of
Baderoon crashing valiantly through the
pirate swarm with it, after his arrows were
all shot away.</p>

<p>The curator put some brandy to Baderoon’s
lips and the “boy” revived. The first thing
he felt for was the tin mirror in his nose.
Finding this still there, he sank back with
a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“There! That’s fine!” encouraged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
curator, holding up the Papuan’s woolly
head. “You-fellah come good-fellah soon,
Baderoon! He’s got quite a rap on the roof
and he’s lost a lot of blood from that arrow
wound where it got torn out during the
scrimmage. Get me my first-aid, quick. He
feels a lot better, now that he knows his
charm is all right!” he chuckled.</p>

<p>Baderoon opened his eyes and an irresistible
grin cracked his thick lips.</p>

<p>“No <i>kai-kai</i> [eat] me-fellah! <i>Orang-kaya</i>
him go <i>Boom!—Boom!</i>—All stop!” he grinned
weakly, snapping all his fingers to imitate
the explosion.</p>

<p>“All right, boy,” beamed the curator.
“You-fellah stop, quiet! Will plenty debbil-debbil
your arm,” he warned, producing the
antiseptics. He shot the iodine into the
open wound, while Baderoon set his teeth
obediently, enduring the pain as best he could.
Then his master wrapped on the gauze and
bandages and hung the arm in a sling, and
they all went out, leaving the native resting
easily on a bench, afraid to touch his bandages
under fear of the <i>orang-kaya’s</i> displeasure.</p>

<p>The proa was bowling along up the lagoon,
sailing farther and farther in behind the
Charles Louis Mountains as they looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
about them. A large river flowed in up at
the head of the lagoon, they knew, but the
curator had decided to take the first creek
mouth that looked uninhabited on the mountain
shore. Not a sign of a village or even
a canoe had they seen, so dense are the mangrove
swamps. Finally a dent in them, at
the end of a long valley between two of the
mountains, came in sight. A careful search
of the trees around it with the glasses revealed
no more native scouts. The curator judged
that they had gotten up to sparsely inhabited
country, and the proa was nosed into a little
bay with the swift, clear water of the creek
running into it. With slack sheet she laid
her prow into the mouth of it, the shores
slipping by close at hand.</p>

<p>He gave the order to go ashore, and,
shouldering their packs, Nicky and Dwight
leaped into the jungle, followed by Sadok
with a huge crate of empty collection boxes
on his back. Baderoon jumped next, able
to walk now, and carrying nothing but his
bow and shield, a borrowed quiver of arrows,
and his captured war club. Then the curator
turned to the <i>jurugan</i>.</p>

<p>“Come back here in three weeks, Captain,”
he said. “We’ll be here waiting for you—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
dead. Good-by, all! Nice fight, wasn’t
it!” A flash of grins swept the crew’s faces
as he seized his light double shotgun and
jumped for the bank. The proa backed off
and soon her sails filled and she stood down
the lagoon, bound for Aru.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, we’re on our own!” said the
curator, cheerfully, joining the rest of the
party. “I reckon we can stay alive for three
weeks in this country! And we ought to have
something to tell about when we get back
here. <i>Paradisea superba</i>, the superb bird of
paradise, is what we particularly want; also
an accurate report on the mineralogy of this
region.”</p>

<p>They picked their way up over clinking
bits of old broken coral, aiming for the high
ground above the source of the stream.
Skirting along this for some distance, they
soon found that it was a small, flat table-land
of some ancient coral growth, back of
which was the real jungle. The sparse soil
was grown with stunted seaside palms and
various species of ironwood and lignum-vitæ.
Through it the stream cut on its way from
the interior. The curator had about decided
to establish camp here until the region could
be investigated before going farther, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
a cry from Nicky aroused them. It came
from farther upstream.</p>

<p>“This way, fellows!” it called; “here’s
something interesting!”</p>

<p>They followed the call, to pitch down the
coral bank to a small beach by the stream-side,
clear of mangroves. An abandoned
outrigger sail canoe lay hauled up on the
shore. The coral flat had protected it from
the moist jungle rot, but its weatherbeaten
planks showed that it had been there for
several years.</p>

<p>“A crocodile slipped into the water as I
came down here, and found—this,” announced
Nicky. “It looks like a Ceram or Salwatty
boat to me. See the single mast and the
two bamboo outriggers.”</p>

<p>She was about twenty-five feet long, with
a bamboo platform overhanging the body of
the canoe on each side astern, its outer edges
guarded with stout bamboo rails. The body
was of flat, hewn planks, built up on a wide
keel hollowed from a single log. The New
Guinea boats were all made of one or more
log canoes, hollowed out of a single log, they
knew; this canoe came from Ke’ or Ceram,
but of its history there was not a trace. The
sail, of woven cotton, still lay wrapped around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
its yards. Two lengths of bamboo, about
twenty feet long and six inches thick, formed
the floating outriggers, which were lashed to
bow-shaped hardwood spars notched across
the gunwales. All her rattan lashings were
in as good shape as the day she was made.</p>

<p>An involuntary shiver of apprehension
went over the party. Others had come—and
never returned!</p>

<p>“Some poor devils ventured in here after
paradise birds and got eaten, I presume,”
said the curator. “It’s a cinch they never
got back! We’ll adopt her. We may need
her some day! Here’s good water and dry
ground, fellows! Let’s camp here and collect
within easy distance until we know the
lay of the land. And we’ll all keep together
for the present, boys,” he ordered, meaningly.</p>

<p>The parangs got busy, and soon a space
was cleared in the underbrush where the
two tent flys of the boys and the curator’s
hammock could be swung. Sadok disappeared
into the jungle, whence the sound of
his chopper soon came, and presently he
returned to camp, bearing a long green pole
of bamboo across his shoulders. This he
notched with footsteps cut above each joint,
and the pole was then laid upright in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
fork of a small ironwood tree. Up it the
curator climbed, to look out over the country.</p>

<p>“That was some look-see, boys!” he announced,
coming down from the pole. “The
mountains lie right near us, to the right,
with a strip of deep jungle, about half a mile
wide, beginning just beyond this table of
coral land. We’ll have to go through it with
compass and parang. This stream comes
down from a notch in the mountains, with
some high grass plateaus shelving out from
their sides. It’s a great country, and I
doubt if anyone finds us for a time yet. I
did not see a sign of a hut or a village. It’s
safe to collect anywhere on this coral ground,
I think. And there are thunderheads coming
over the mountains to the west right
now, so make your tents secure for the night
and cook whatever you’re going to before
the rain comes.”</p>

<p>Nicky did not care to eat just then, so he
set out on an exploring trip. For some
distance he poked along, slowly, above the
course of the stream, starting at every rustle
of big land crabs scuttling for their holes in
the underbrush. The growth of tangled ironwoods
was so thick that he had to hack with
his parang to get even through the thinnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
vistas. He moved slowly along, the thrill
of being alone in an unknown land peopled
with savage cannibals putting his nerves on
edge. He recalled stories of how the Outanatas
did not eat a man whole, like the South
Sea Islanders, but had a playful way of
cutting off a leg and binding up the stump,
saving the man for further feasts while they
ate the leg before his eyes; and how, last
year, six Javanese had been suddenly decapitated
by the Tugeri, just inside the barbed
wire of the Dutch fort at Merauke, and
how—</p>

<p><i>Brrrrumm!</i>—right behind him! It might
have been the grunt of a wild boar: it might
have been—anything! Nicky jumped, whirling
in the air, electrified with fear, and landed
on his feet with gun cocked and staring eyes.
Nothing whatever was visible. The dense
brush was as silent and inscrutable as the
Sphinx. Trying to quiet his pounding heart,
the boy began to turn cautiously around,
when—<i>Brrrruuumm!</i> right behind him again!
He whirled about, angry this time, looking
with all his eyes for something to shoot at.</p>

<p><i>Brruum!—Brrumm!</i> The sound seemed to
come from overhead, and, looking up, Nicky
saw a large air plant, its blatant flowers in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
showy profusion—and hovering in front of
them was a large tropical humming bird!</p>

<p>The revulsion was too great! The boy
threw back his head and yelled with hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p>“Frightened to death by a humming bird!”
he whooped. “<i>Yow-yowri!</i> Well, it’s time
I shoved along and accomplished something!”</p>

<p>He pushed his way through the thickets,
defiantly now, hoping that something <i>would</i>
turn up worth shooting at. Presently he
came to a little open glade grown up with
saw grass, with a small pond in the center of
it. As he burst through the thicket two
animals rose up out of the grass across the
pond and went jumping off, sailing over the
yellow field in long leaps that carried them
twenty feet to the bound. Nicky did not
have to be told that they were wallabys, the
New Guinea species of kangaroo. He whipped
out his long-barreled Officer’s Model and
poised its fine sights on the rearmost wallaby.
He had learned through long practice that
his revolver was as good as a rifle at any
range up to seventy-five yards, if well handled,
and he depended on it for all big game. As
the gun barked, the wallaby pitched down,
rolling over and over like a rabbit in the saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
grass, its long hind legs kicking convulsively.
The other wallaby soared in a frantic series
of hops, and reached the jungle before the
wavering sights of the revolver could be
steadied on it.</p>

<p>Nicky started to dash through the grass
around the pond after his prize, but the sudden
soar of a small animal like a flying squirrel,
but much larger, brought him to a full stop.
It had left the topmost branches of a tall
thorn tree on the edge of the jungle and had
volplaned downward in a long flight across
the opening. Nicky’s ready shotgun sprang
to shoulder and he covered it in full flight
and pulled trigger. The creature fell into
the grass as he blew the smoke from his
barrel and slipped in another shell. A single
step forward developed more life, for a large
green grasshopper like a katydid sprang
from its depths, made a short flight, and lit
near by. It had a peculiar shield like a leaf
curved backward over its head. Nicky
whipped off his helmet to capture it, for he
recognized the great shielded grasshopper of
New Guinea and he knew that Dwight would
want it.</p>

<p>He crept forward stealthily, when his eye
was attracted by the bright flash of orange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and black where a medium-sized bird was
hopping from branch to branch in the thicket
to his right. One glance at the quantity of
long feathers of an intense orange hue that
adorned its neck told him that it was the
rare paradise oriole, closely allied to the true
paradise birds and a specimen of the utmost
value to the curator.</p>

<p>Nicky raised his gun, embarrassed at all
these sudden riches of natural history that
surrounded him. It occurred to him that
this little pond bore all the aspects of the
African water hole, in that it attracted wild
life as a sort of center, and that he could
spend a long time right here without beginning
to exhaust its possibilities. As the gun
barked the bird fell tumbling through the
thicket and the boy reloaded, wondering
what new marvel would develop at his very
next step. Then the grasshopper claimed
his attention. It had made another short
flight. This time the helmet scooped him
in. He paused a moment to wonder over
the remarkable camouflage that nature had
provided for this insect, for the shield resembled
a green leaf so closely that a passing
hornet or bird, which were its chief enemies,
would be completely deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>In lieu of a better place to put it, Nicky
pinned it on his helmet and then resolutely
trailed through the grass to find the small
flying creature that he had shot, unmindful
of the quantities of insects that he had
stirred up, the very number and diversity
of which would have driven Dwight into a
frenzy.</p>

<p>“Must tell the old scout about this!”
muttered the boy. “He’d camp here a
week! Ought to be something in my line,
too, around this water. Heigho! What in
the dickens is this?” he exclaimed, picking
up the animal. It <i>looked</i> like an opossum,
but it had broad furry membranes extending
from fore to hind leg exactly like our own
flying squirrel.</p>

<p>“Flying opossum, by ginger!” cried the
boy, for he had of course read up on all the
natural history of New Guinea that is known.
He examined the curious creature with all
the sensations of the true naturalist. It is
a far different thing to read of these examples
of nature’s marvelous diversity, than to
actually handle and examine the creatures
themselves. Like all but two of New Guinea’s
mammals, this was a marsupial, a reminder
of that far time when all of Papua, Australia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and the adjacent islands connected by the
shallow sea was one vast continent, entirely
separated from Asia by deep sea. <i>Why</i> did
this continent evolve marsupials in every
form of animal life, even the bear and the
wolf? Here was the counterpart of our flying
squirrel, with the same protective capacity
to fly, but a marsupial and by structure most
closely allied to the opossums. It was surely
a brave conundrum!</p>

<p>He retrieved the paradise oriole and started
out to the pond again, but a sharp hiss in the
grass stopped him like an electric shock. A
black and mottled snake rose threateningly,
with steely tongue quivering from its mouth.
Nicky recoiled, shielding his eyes with his
arm, for he had recognized with a shock of
loathing fear the dreaded death adder of
Papua, which can spit poison with considerable
accuracy for more than six feet. He
backed off rapidly, watching the snake narrowly,
for he knew that it would attack with
great swiftness, blinding his eyes before
striking. Then his shotgun sprang to shoulder
as the snake moved toward him through the
grass, and he pulled trigger as its horned
head appeared for an instant over the tubes.
Out of the mist of smoke and the confusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of the recoil Nicky had time to realize but
one thing—that head was still weaving toward
him with the speed of an express train! It
would not do to aim the gun again and so
expose his eyes. He turned to fly, dropping
his gun and tugging frantically at his parang.
As it flashed from its wooden sheath he made
a swift backhand slash with it, urged by the
imminent horror of the snake being close
behind him. He felt the parang’s blade cut
bone, and at the same instant something
soft and wet struck the back of his neck
and a hot, irritating pain seared his flesh.
Putting up his hand as he ran, he found his
fingers covered with a pale yellow fluid that
burnt where it touched. Nicky stopped at
the thicket and faced about. A violent
thrashing of coils in the grass behind him,
now flashing up the white belly, now the
mottled back, told him that he had beheaded
the adder. He went back cautiously, for
he appreciated now that the borders of that
pond would be alive with snakes. He got
to water finally, and began washing strenuously.
The pain still kept up, however,
and he could feel a large blister raising on
the skin of his neck.</p>

<p>“I must get back to camp quickly, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the curator can paint me with iodine!” he
muttered to himself. “What would happen
if I should faint here in the jungle!”</p>

<p>He found the head of the death adder and
wrapped it in his handkerchief and tied it
to his belt. The body was about eight feet
long. Dragging it over to the thicket, he
hung it on a bush and then skirted around,
keeping a sharp watch at his feet, and finally
came out to the body of the wallaby.</p>

<p>It was very like the great gray kangaroo
of Australia, but much smaller and reddish
in color. He swung it over his shoulder and
retraced his steps to the thicket. Tying the
long body of the adder to his belt, he pushed
for camp. He felt dizzy and weak, and sick
at the stomach, and his neck burnt like a
fire. Staggering on, he sought the thinnest
openings in the brush and so unconsciously
retraced his steps; but the briers tore at him
and his burden with maddening tenacity and
he steadily grew weaker and weaker. At
last the welcome sound of voices and chopping
came to his ears, and with a last burst of
endurance he drove through the thickets
and fell forward limply, just over the edge of
their clearing.</p>

<p>The curator dropped his microscope and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
notebook and ran over, followed by Dwight,
who had heard his startled exclamation.</p>

<p>“Man, animal, or reptile?” giggled Dwight,
looking down at the odd huddle of wallaby,
snake, and boy that was Nicky.</p>

<p>“Cut it, and call Sadok and Baderoon!
Quick!” snapped the curator, sharply. “Something
has happened to him. Nothing is ever
trivial in this jungle, Dwight!” He pulled
off the wallaby as he spoke, and his eyes fell
at once on the red scar on the back of Nicky’s
neck. He examined it carefully, but no sign
of fangs was visible.</p>

<p>“Go get the medicine kit!” he barked, as
Dwight left on the run. Baderoon came up,
and his eyes opened as they lit on the body of
the snake.</p>

<p>“<i>Koikoim meten!</i>” he gasped, horror-stricken.
“Me go find’m taboo for him—quick!
Boy him die!” He dashed off into
the jungle. Sadok bent over, shaking his
head. The snake was unfamiliar to him and
he could do nothing. Dwight returned with
the medicine kit and the curator painted the
spot with iodine, but it seemed to have no
effect. Nicky was in a kind of swoon, from
which all efforts, even brandy, failed to arouse
him. Faces lengthened as the minutes went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
by with no improvement. Finally Baderoon
emerged from the jungle, carrying a spray
of some kind of plant.</p>

<p>“Me find’m taboo!” He grinned cheerfully.
He crushed the weed in his hands and
rubbed the juice on the spot, kneading it in
and crooning a wild Papuan chant the while.
After some five minutes of it, which seemed
like five weeks to the white men looking on,
Nicky opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Gee! I could—write a—fine story—about
this!” he sighed, weakly. “I’ve been conscious
all the time,” he went on, more strongly
as Baderoon kept up his vigorous kneading,
“but for the life of me I could not move anything.
Seemed to be kind of paralyzed.
Baderoon—you’re a brick!” he cried, grasping
the mop-haired Papuan’s horny hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Orang-kichil</i> [little chief] all right? Me
make’m <i>koikoim</i> debbil-debbil!” he grinned,
kneading steadily and applying more of the
pale-green plant juice.</p>

<p>Nicky told them all about it as he steadily
grew stronger, and finally he sat up and undid
the handkerchief holding the snake’s head.
“It’s a fine specimen, all right, though!” he
maintained, stoutly. “Baderoon, you fix’m
koikoim’s—isn’t it?—koikoim’s head, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
we’ll save the whole of him for mounting.
Me for a sleep for a thousand years!”</p>

<p>They got Nicky tucked away for the night
and his tent fly secured down strongly like
a wedge tent, for great plashes of raindrops
were beginning to fall and the rolling thunder
came nearer and nearer down the mountains.
Then came the roar of the rain, and bright,
vivid flashes of lightning rent the twilight.</p>

<p>Sadok and Baderoon moved their mats
under the curator’s hammock fly, while rain
drove in sheets through the tropical night.
It was furious while it lasted, but by eight
o’clock the storm had died to distant mutterings
far back in the interior, and a pitch
blackness ensued. Then the stars came out,
and in the moist, steaming stillness the camp
went off to sleep for their first night in the
New Guinea jungle.</p>

<small>THE OUTANATAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR the next few days the water hole
became a star collecting ground for the
entire expedition. Nicky was laid up a day
in camp, recovering from the effects of the
death adder’s poison, but he soon came to
haunt the pond, for it and the stream that
flowed past their camp were his main reliance
for abundance of reptilian life.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we make the main collection,
fellows,” said the curator, as he and
Sadok came back to their temporary headquarters
loaded with curious hook-billed
Macrorhina kingfishers, magnificent crowned
pigeons, Manucodia starlings of brilliant hues
of plumage, blue flycatcher wrens, and many
other species of the abundant bird life of
New Guinea.</p>

<p>“We’ll fill the main collection crates with
a representative collection in all four divisions
of natural history. That will leave us free
to concentrate on the rarer varieties during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the exploration trip,” he continued. “I vote
we have a pig hunt to-morrow. Baderoon
tells me he has discovered plentiful rootings
down in that mass of high jungle that separates
us from the mountain chain. We ought
to lay in some fresh meat and cure some bacon
before starting into the interior.”</p>

<p>“Me for the hogfest!” crowed Nicky.
“I’ve about nailed every lizard, tree frog,
and snakelet in this vicinity. What ammunition
shall we use, sir?”</p>

<p>“For wild boar I’m inclined to the solid
ounce ball in a twelve-gauge shotgun,”
grinned the curator. “It’s the only thing
that will stop ’em at close range. Beats a
high-power rifle all hollow, for it knocks ’em
down to stay. I brought along some shells
loaded with three-quarter ounce ball for our
twenty-gauges, and we’ll serve ’em out
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>On the next day the pig hunt was started.
The wild pig of New Guinea, <i>Sus papuana</i>,
is in several respects peculiar to himself.
Armed with those long tusks that the natives
use for nose ornaments and breast shields,
he is wild, long legged, and speedy as a deer.
He has the typical Asiatic screw tail, in place
of the long straight one of the wild boar of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
Europe, but is almost hairless and provided
with thick horny shoulder plates under the
skin that will turn almost any bullet. Like
all pigs, he fights well when cornered, is very
tenacious of life, and attacks with a slashing
charge of his tusks, attempting to upset a
man with his momentum and then turn and
rend out his ribs with a powerful stroke of
the long, sharp tushes.</p>

<p>Baderoon and Sadok disappeared into the
jungle to get above their feeding ground and
act as beaters, while the curator and the boys
took up vantage points a short distance back
from the creek in the swampy bottoms.</p>

<p>Dwight soon found himself alone under
the tall foliage, with vines and creepers
crisscrossing in front of him and dense undergrowth,
making it impossible to see thirty
feet away, all around him. Great, slippery
roots buttressed out from the tree trunks,
crawling over the muddy soil like alligator
backs. Nicky and the curator were farther
on down the creek, both as silent as the
grave, for it was essential to make no noise.
Dwight realized that he had been given the
post of honor this time, and that it would be
he who would bear the brunt of the charge.
In spite of himself he found himself shivering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
with excitement, opening his gun to peer at
the shells, setting the safety on and off, and
otherwise betraying symptoms that looked
very like fear. He had never hunted wild
boar before, and he found himself wishing
that he had a bayonet or a spear or something
to defend himself at close quarters.
As it was, he would have to depend entirely
on steady nerves and a well-placed bullet.</p>

<p>Then, far up the jungle, he heard the distant
noises of the infernal din that Sadok
and Baderoon were making, yelling and
beating with their spears on their shields.
It was followed presently by faint squeals,
and later he could hear the grunts, it seemed,
of a whole drove of wild boars. They were
coming like the wind, the undergrowth crackling
under their hoofs, vines tearing and
ripping and carrying away bush growth, and
then the jungle floor fairly shook, as if locomotives
were thundering down on him.</p>

<p>A swishing and waving in the undergrowth
showed him that they would pass him about
thirty yards off, between him and the creek.
Dwight sternly repressed an impulse to hang
back and let them go by. To see clearly to
shoot, he would have to run forward and
plant himself nearly in their path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Don’t be a coward! <i>Into</i> this, you boob!”
he swore at himself, as he drove forward
through the tangle of jungle growth. He
ran out on a great prone trunk and peered
into the moving bushes. They were going
by, grunting and squealing with mixed terror
and anger—five of them, and two great big
fellows, with long, wicked ivory tushes curling
around their snouts. Dwight raised the
twenty-bore, followed along back of the
shoulder of the nearest, and fired. Instantly
a bawl of pain and rage went up as the boar
stopped, whirling about a broken foreleg and
looking about him red eyed with rage. The
rest went thundering on, and a boom from
the curator’s gun rang through the jungle.
Dwight’s boar spied him and came hitching
toward him on three legs, grunting his rage.
The boy had opened his gun to slip in another
shell, so eager was he to have plenty of shots.
In an electric shock of realization, he saw
that he had not time to do anything of the
sort. Hastily snapping it shut, he drew a
wavering bead and fired again. The ball
hit somewhere in the shoulder and glanced
off, but it put the boar in a frightful rage.
He charged the log with a red glare in his
eyes and leaped up, his tusks sweeping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
upper surface of it. Dwight leaped off and
reloaded frantically in the brief breathing
space left him. With a leap like a deer, the
boar went over the trunk, while Dwight fired
both barrels full into his head at six feet, and
then turned and dashed into the jungle. A
great vine caught under his armpits as the
boy crashed into it, and it laid him sprawling
in the thick bush growth. He wormed
through it desperately, and reloaded, wondering
all the time why he had not been gored
and trampled to death. His heart pounded
so that its rapid beats were audible as he
opened his mouth to breathe. Then he realized
that the boar had not followed,
and, plucking up courage, he stole back to
look.</p>

<p>There lay the boar, threshing feebly about
beside the log, his life slowly ebbing away.
Dwight watched him, afraid to come nearer,
scarce daring to hope that he had won. A
final convulsion, and the boar seemed to go
to sleep as he gave a last little sigh and
stretched his great head out on the jungle.</p>

<p>“Whoops! I’ve got him!” yelled Dwight,
stepping nearer to prod at the carcass with
his gun barrels.</p>

<p>“Had a fat time with him, too, judging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
by the noise!” laughed the curator’s voice.
“I got one, too—nice pig.”</p>

<p>Dwight remembered that the curator had
fired but one shot—coolly and carefully
placed, no doubt, but he was not ashamed.
He had done well, for his first try! Nicky
had not fired at all, for the rest of the drove
had swerved and crossed the creek in a splash
at the two gunshots. He and the curator
came over to look at his trophy.</p>

<p>“Ought to cut out those and wear them
in your nose, to be really fashionable in New
Guinea, Dwight!” laughed Nicky, pointing
to the razor-sharp tushes. “I was just
coming over to lend a hand to help the
curator up a tree when he fired, and the
rest of the family beat it across the creek.
Out o’ luck, as usual!” he grinned, cheerfully.</p>

<p>After a time Sadok and Baderoon came up
and set about butchering the two pigs. The
bacon flitches and hams from them were
cured over a smoke rack during the next two
days, while the party dined on fresh liver,
and, later, pork chops, after the game had
hung for a day.</p>

<p>On the third morning the whole party left
camp with two days’ provisions, to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
first exploration of the table-lands back in
the mountains. They steered across the
jungle by compass, Sadok and Baderoon
clearing the way with their parangs. Then
the ground began to rise, and slowly they
worked up from the wild profusion of equatorial
jungle into the more arid growths of the
mountain side. The going became easier,
as on all high ground, and the nature of the
wild life and vegetation began to change.
New insects and birds became numerous,
and their progress was slow because nearly
all of them were wanted for the collections,
and the curator knew from long experience
that the time to take a specimen was when
you saw him, for you might not get another.</p>

<p>By midafternoon they had reached the
plateaus near the notch in the mountains,
and here they encountered their brook again.
But what a different stream from the smooth,
deep, jungly creek flowing silently down
below through overhanging arches of vines
and creepers! Here its bed was wide and
pebbly as any northern stream, the creek
following the deepest parts, with dry bars
of pebbles scoured clean by former freshets.
Wild trees of the coffee and Euphorbia families,
thorns, and acacias dotted the stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
banks. It was hot up here, but dry, and a
pleasant place to live in. The curator was
examining the pebbles eagerly, to get some
idea of the rock formations of the mountains,
when Sadok whistled softly and pointed
upstream. A party of tall black natives
was threading through the forest, and their
leaders were already splashing across the
stream bed! They stopped instantly as they
spied the khaki helmets of the explorers,
and more warriors joined them. It was a
war party, as they could tell by the white-streaked
faces, the weapons they carried,
and the white breastplates of boars’ tusks
that they had seen in museums before.</p>

<p>“Outanatas,” said the curator, quietly, as
their party drew together for support. “We’ll
stand right here and watch what they do.”</p>

<p>The tall, slender, mop-haired savages
splashed through the creek, about twenty-five
of them in the party, and they were
armed with spears, bows, and clubs. Each
man had a shield on his left arm, made of
some tough wood, carved in red and white
scrolls. They shouted and yelled at the
curator’s party as they bunched together on
the strand of the creek, and then came running
swiftly down the pebbly drift, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
long skinny legs shining with white amulets
of sea shells.</p>

<p>“Holler, ‘Friends!’ at them, Baderoon-boy,”
said the curator as they came nearer,
hesitating and staring at the white men.</p>

<p>“<i>Muana komia!</i>” cried Baderoon, dropping
his bow and shield in sign of amity.</p>

<p>The natives yelled. Whether it was friendly
or derisive they could not tell. Then they
formed in an irregular line and began a war
dance toward the party.</p>

<p>“They’re showing off, I think,” declared
the curator. “If they meant war, every
man jack of them would have melted into the
jungle and be shooting at us by now. Still,
we’d better be on our guard.”</p>

<p>He dug into a flap pocket of his belt and
took out a trench grenade, while the boys
loosened their revolver flaps cautiously, their
shotguns hanging loosely in their arms. Sadok
reached for his parang, but the curator
stopped him.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Sadok; we can’t make the first
hostile move. I’ll give an order if I think
they’re getting dangerous.”</p>

<p>The natives came on, yelling and dancing.
Most of them wore long white boars’ tusks
through the nose and curving up around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
their cheeks, giving them a singularly fierce
aspect. Some had white shell combs dangling
low over their foreheads, and nearly all
wore a collection of white shell rings hanging
in their ears. They brandished their spears
and clubs as they advanced and retreated,
going through the pantomime of mimic warfare.
They made diabolical faces and thrust
out red tongues at the explorers as they came
closer, but whether it was war or peace even
Baderoon could not tell them.</p>

<p>The boys watched the war dance, striving
to quiet the shivers of apprehension that
<i>would</i> persist in rising. It was harder to
bear there than any amount of fighting, and
they had much preferred standing off any
number of natives well hidden in the bush.</p>

<p>At about fifteen yards off, the line of
natives had worked themselves into furious
action, stabbing with their spears at the air,
the rows of hideous shields dancing like evil
genii from some other world. As more of
them spread out on each flank, a guttural
shout came from one of the tallest.</p>

<p>“Shoot, <i>Orang</i>!” shrieked Baderoon, but
he was too late! From behind each native’s
shield swung a black arm holding a short
stick of bamboo. They swept forward like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
flails, and instantly the air was filled with
blinding fine sand and ash dust. It closed
their eyes with the acrid, cutting particles,
and involuntarily their arms went up to
shield their faces, while guns went off aimlessly.
Sadok flashed out his parang in the
cloud, and the curator jumped back to throw
his bomb, but there was no room to use it.
The natives closed in on them in a whirlwind
of grabbing, skinny arms. Dwight saw stars
as a club descended on his helmet, and everything
went white before him. He was dimly
conscious of a last impression of Sadok
standing off three of them with his parang,
and the curator buffeting his way through
the shields toward him with bare fists, when
his senses left him....</p>

<p>When he came to he was lying on the
ground with his arms tightly bound behind
him. Nicky and the curator were sitting up,
also tied, and beyond them was Sadok, his
head covered with blood where they had
clubbed him. An occasional suppressed groan
came from Baderoon; only themselves could
understand the agony he was enduring, with
his wounded arm ruthlessly trussed up like
their own.</p>

<p>The Outanatas were chattering and arguing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
around them. Finally a long rope was
brought and the captives tied together, a
loop of it in a single knot around each of
their necks, so that any attempt to escape
would bring it tight. Then they were all
dragged to their feet and formed in a line,
with a double file of natives on each side, and
the party set off through the jungle.</p>

<p>The way led back through the same trail
the natives had come up on, the jungle path
working gradually down toward the lagoon.
The boys did little talking, for it seemed to
make their captors angry, but they had
plenty of time to think as they marched
along. Dwight noted that the curator still
carried his queer pistol, and their own were
in the holsters yet, for the natives had dropped
the flaps in disgust at the first sight of steel.
Their shotguns were being carried by a
couple of natives, each holding it with a
wad of moss in his hand to protect it from
the touch of steel, against which they had a
taboo. Sadok’s sumpitan, with its spear
blade lashed to its muzzle like a spear, they
could understand, and his parang and Nicky’s
were in the hands of their captors. They
evidently respected these as real weapons
of war, as they also did Baderoon’s bows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
arrows and both the shields, for these were
being carried along as trophies.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096fp.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THE WAY LED BACK THROUGH THE SAME TRAIL THE<br>
NATIVES HAD COME UP ON, THE JUNGLE PATH<br>
WORKING GRADUALLY DOWNWARD TO THE LAGOON</p>

<p>By nightfall the trail pitched suddenly
downward toward the lagoon, and the warriors
raised their voices in an exulting chant.
It was answered by the deep boom of war
drums, and presently they came down to a
native village on the shore of the lagoon.
The mangroves had been cleared away here,
and on the beach were some twenty long
black canoes, hauled up, their high carved
prows looming darkly against the glassy
surface of the waters, greenish orange in the
dying hues of twilight.</p>

<p>The huts of the village were of bamboo,
arched up from ground to ground over a
stout ridge pole, and thatched with palm
attap. An excited crowd of native men
gathered around their party, while the warriors
went on singing and dancing, telling
in vigorous pantomime the story of their
capture. There seemed to be no central
chief, but some of the older and more powerful
warriors at length came to some sort of
agreement, and they were all thrust into an
empty hut, the men who had captured their
weapons claiming the duty of being guards.</p>

<p>The explorers sat watchful on the clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
sand floor of the hut, with their guards standing
in the doorway. A great fire was started
out in front, and they could see even the
women and children, now, venturing from
the huts. Log after log was piled on the
fire, and then pairs of natives passed the door,
carrying between them huge, rounded stones.
One after another these were laid on the fire,
and gradually they became red hot underneath,
while the upper surfaces were smooth
and sooty in the licking flames.</p>

<p>“Prenty bad!” whispered Baderoon in the
curator’s ear. “Fire dance! Make you-fellah
hopp’m on rock till he cook you’ foots.
Den dey <i>kai-kai</i> dat foots. Leg, he stop,
’til next time. All <i>kai-kai</i> some day.”</p>

<p>It was time to act! The curator shifted
his trick ring with his thumb and opened the
catch when it came inside his palm. His
fingers closed around his right wrist and
sought the binding of twisted pandanus leaf.
A steady scratch-scratching of the little blade
in the ring on the leaf fiber went on, while
their guards looked out the door, watching
the preparations.</p>

<small>THE CURATOR’S AIR PISTOL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE flickering red lights from the dying
flames of the fire lit up the walls of the
hut as the curator sat, free, with his hands
still behind him, considering what to do next.
The fiery glow of embers under the hot stones
urged him to speedy action, for already the
tom-toms of trumpet-shaped Papuan war
drums and the whang of stringed instruments
had struck up. The natives were
yelling for the first prisoner to be brought
out. He did not propose that their party
should go on stumps for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>He reached carefully for the hunting knife
in his belt, and, leaning up against Baderoon,
his arm slipped behind him and cut his
thongs. Then the knife was passed on, and
Baderoon freed Sadok. The three silently
arose and crept toward the guards leaning
out the door. Fingers moved stealthily for
their necks, while the boys watched them
tensely. With a sudden pounce, both guards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
were seized and dragged within the hut
without a sound. Sadok was strong as a
gorilla, and his man soon ceased to struggle.
The curator and Baderoon had more trouble
with theirs, for the black had only one good
arm, but the guard was finally subdued,
gagged, and tied after a silent tussle in which
all three joined. Then the boys were freed,
and Sadok jumped for his sumpitan, parang,
and kriss, which leaned up against the walls
of the hut.</p>

<p>“This way—quick now!” hissed the curator,
pointing to the blank rear wall of the hut.
Sadok ripped a door in it with his kriss, while
the curator drew his pistol, inserted a small
metal cylinder in its breech, and shoved
down hard with the muzzle of the weapon
on an abandoned shield of the guards. A
crinkly noise like a spring came from within
it, and he smiled grimly and replaced the
pistol in its holster. Then they all crept out
through the back wall into the dark jungle,
Baderoon helping himself liberally to weapons
as he left.</p>

<p>Dwight, tingling with excitement, automatic
in hand, crawled along on all-fours
behind the curator, who followed Sadok,
and so they worked steadily toward the beach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
over the thick, soft duff. At length the last
of the line of canoes, close to the boundary
of mangroves, rose up ahead, and, one by
one, they crawled around both sides of it,
keeping below the gunwale out of sight.
The lurid glow of the fire was behind them,
and, silhouetted against it were circles of
mop-haired savages, singing in unison with
the beat of the drums, the warriors dancing
around the fire.</p>

<p>Quietly they rose and lifted the bow of the
long boat. Her stern was afloat and she
gave easily, but it took their combined
strength to shove her out. At last she
floated, and they all got in, Sadok giving
her a last artful shove that sent her silently
around the end of the mangroves and out
of sight. They groped for paddles, dipped
them noiselessly, and stole along, close to
shore, not even a ripple coming from her
prow. The noise behind them grew gradually
more indistinct, until the rhythmical
dub-dub of the drums alone reached them.</p>

<p>“Whoosh!” sighed Nicky, at last, and it
seemed he had been holding his breath for a
week. “Some getaway! But it’s about
time those beggars went for their lunch,
though!” he observed, facetiously, while his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
powerful shoulders swept the paddle easily.
“‘My—word!’ as Bentham would say, but
I don’t fancy being fried on stones for these
heathen! I’ve contributed too many blankets
and things to missionary boxes—and I want
my money back!” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” ordered the curator, sternly.
“This show isn’t over yet, and there may be
scouts along shore. We’ve got to make
time!”</p>

<p>They bent to the paddles, driving the
heavy canoe along down the shore of the
lagoon. Fifteen tense minutes passed, while
black palm fronds and ragged banana leaves
swept by overhead past the stars. They
had put nearly a mile between them and the
landing when—</p>

<p>“Hist!” called the curator, stopping his
paddle suddenly.</p>

<p>A riot of excited yells came faintly through
the jungle.</p>

<p>“They’re wise! Hep, boys! <i>hep!</i>” They
drove the canoe along as fast as she could
be made to go. She needed at least ten
paddlers to get any real speed out of her,
and the boys realized that there would be
more doings this night! A clearer burst of
sounds told that the natives had come down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to the beach and discovered their missing
canoe. Then torches glared out over the
black, glassy water, and presently a fleet of
canoes set out, each with a blazing brand
flaming on its prow. Some of them set out
across the lagoon, others went upstream,
and eight started down the shore, moving
abreast and covering the water far out.
Nothing could escape them!</p>

<p>“Make for the open, Sadok!” called the
curator over his shoulder to the Dyak, who
was stern paddle. “We haven’t a chance
here, but we might get by them out beyond
the last one out there.”</p>

<p>They drove the canoe out on the broad
bosom of the lagoon, the lights from the
eight flares streaming across the water to
them in long red pencils, and it seemed
incredible that they were not seen already.
The curator, however, knew better the actual
range of a flare visible from the eyes of a
man in the boat with it, for he had tried it
before, jacking deer. The lights came steadily
on, yells and whoops blaring over the waters.
The canoes soon passed them, in a long, straggly
line between them and the shore.</p>

<p>They stopped their own boat and watched
their pursuers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Gee! it’s a clean escape!” exulted Dwight,
“and we’re bows on, so it’s impossible to see
us—” The enthusiasm in his voice trailed
off as they all paused, holding their breaths,
to watch the flare on the nearest canoe. It
seemed to be parting in two and the second
light grew to a long flame. Then it suddenly
rose in a high, curving arc as a flaming
javelin went up like a rocket. A weird glare
lit up the water far and wide.</p>

<p>“Clever stunt! Those savages are sure
resourceful, I’ll say!” admired the curator.
“We’re <i>it</i>, all right!”</p>

<p>A babel of yells arose from the nearest
canoe as he spoke, and her light began to
move out toward them, the flashes of her
paddles winking like swiftly waving bars of
light. The other canoes changed course likewise,
and the whole pack fanned out in a
sort of V, with the nearest canoe leading. A
second flaming javelin soared into the night
and lit up the waters. Diabolical war whoops
burst out from all the canoes this time, and
amid exulting yells a few long-range, roving
arrows fell into the lagoon around them.</p>

<p>“Don’t anybody shoot, except Sadok, until
I say the word!” gritted the curator, “and I
want you boys to call me eighty yards as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
near as you can judge it when that canoe
comes that near!”</p>

<p>Arrows from the nearest boat now began
to whistle overhead and fall into the bay
with a sharp <i>chrrp!</i> like quenching hot iron.</p>

<p>“Eighty yards, I think, sir,” whispered
Dwight a few moments later as he peered
over the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Just about,” muttered the curator, aiming
his pistol carefully over braced knees. A
sharp <i>kjkrrr!</i> came from the weapon as he
pulled trigger. A tiny spark swept in a flat
trajectory over to the canoe, and then, like
detonation of thunder close at hand, came a
stunning report and the white, blinding glare
of the explosion of a shell. The flash gave
them one tremendous, significant glimpse of
flying splinters and the cannibal canoe doubling
up like a broken stick—and then came
pitchy, inky darkness, followed by the shouts
of the savages swimming in the water and
the roar of a wave rolling swiftly toward them
which rocked their canoe to her beam ends.</p>

<p>“Gad! I hate to shoot up these beggars,
even if they are cannibals bent on dining off
us!” exclaimed the curator, reloading. “Hope
they’re mostly scared to death! This second
shell ought to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>He steadied the pistol on his knees and
aimed at the second canoe, swooping down
on them, the cannibals yelling and discharging
flights of arrows into the night. Again
the blinding white flash and the terrific
report. The curator had aimed it so as not
to hit the canoe directly, and they saw a wave
rise in front of her which engulfed the canoe
and put her crew powerless in the water.</p>

<p>But the others came right on, regardless.
“Paddle, boys! Make it quick and snappy!
They’re closing in on us! Once more ought
to knock the fight out of them!” He reloaded
hurriedly and fired at the third canoe, the
shell exploding in midair right over it. The
shouts from five canoefuls of bloodthirsty
cannibals surrounding them, foaming up the
water with their furious paddles, filled the
night with pandemonium. Their situation
looked desperate now, for the Outanatas
seemed determined upon their recapture and
they had lost some of their fear of the curator’s
shells.</p>

<p>“Fire, boys! for all you’re worth—I’ll give
you light!” he yelled, whipping out his flashlight.
“Hold it, Baderoon!” he ordered, as
the rays from its parabolic reflector shot
over the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>The automatics began to bark, while the
negro crouched behind the gunwales, shivering
with fear, yet holding the light steadily
on two war canoes bunched close together.
The curator aimed a short-range shell right
over them, hoping to founder the remaining
canoes. The fearful concussion of the T. N.
T. knocked their own party sprawling, and,
where there had been two canoes, now there
was a boiling geyser of water in which they
rose like tossed logs, their crews tumbling
headlong through the white glare. It proved
too much for the remaining three canoes.
The flashlight showed them turning tail and
paddling away in frantic haste.</p>

<p>“Travel, Nigger, Travel!—that’s what
T. N. T. means!” whooped the curator.
“Paddle, boys, after ’em—<i>hard</i>! I’m going
to put the fear of God into these people!”</p>

<p>He aimed the air gun at a high arc, and the
shell whistled on its way. High over the
three canoes it exploded, with the strength
of giant-powder fireworks. Under its glare
they could see the paddlers knocked hurtling
with the concussion.</p>

<p>Baderoon laughed uproariously. “<i>Yow-yowri!</i>
Prenty debbil-debbil, <i>Orang-kaya!</i>
Make’m thunder—<i>Boom! Boom!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Threw a good scare into ’em! That’s the
ticket!” grinned the curator. “They’ll swim
ashore pretty well gentled, I’m thinking!—Keep
after ’em, boys, as hard as you can
make her go! They’re gaining on us!”</p>

<p>He raised the air gun to its utmost elevation
and the tiny streak of fire of the fuse
rose in a high arc. It fell into the bay ahead
of the three canoes, and there was a muffled
thud which blew the whole bottom out of
the bay. A white avalanche of water came
roaring toward the three canoes and their
bows rose dizzily and then the sterns flipped
high in the air. A babel of yells and shouts
told of one canoe upset, and then they steadied
their own to meet the onrushing wave. It
rocked giddily, like a bark canoe in a boiling
rapids, and water slapped over her sides in
a deluge, but her deep keel held her upright.</p>

<p>“Bail, Dwight—and you, too, Baderoon!”
ordered the curator. “Nicky, you and Sadok
keep on paddling. Don’t kill yourselves, as
we’re out of range of them now. I’m going
up to that village and lay down the law to
that whole tribe! They’ll let white men
alone, after that.”</p>

<p>They followed slowly in the wake of the
two fleeing canoes, and finally lay floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
idly about a mile out in front of the village.
The canoes that had gone across the lagoon
and those from upstream had now returned,
as they could see by the assembling flares at
the landing. Howlings and constant booming
of drums came over the water. They dozed
on the thwarts, letting the canoe drift and
waiting for dawn. The noise on shore kept
up throughout the night, but, after an interminable
wait, a faint paling in the east,
which swiftly grew to daylight over the calm
waters of the lagoon, set them to paddling
slowly toward the shore again.</p>

<p>As they drew near it was full daylight and
the clouds overhead were already aflame with
the rising sun. The curator loaded his air gun
and stood up in the bow as they approached
the landing. A deathlike silence reigned
throughout the jungle. The long black canoes
lay hauled up in rows, deserted, and not a
sign of life appeared in the huts nor in the
glades under the coco palms.</p>

<p>As their bow grated on the beach, the
curator took careful aim at the largest of the
huts and fired. The jungle shook with the
sharp detonation as the building was torn
asunder in crackling walls of bamboo and rattan
which immediately took fire. Runnings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
and scamperings in the forest—and then all
was silent as the grave again.</p>

<p>They stepped ashore in a compact little
party, the boys with ready pistols, Sadok’s
long sumpitan sweeping every glade for a
mark. The curator walked to the center of
the clearing and swept the surrounding forest
with his arm.</p>

<p>“Pigs!” he pronounced, in the Arfak dialect,
waving his arm around comprehensively.</p>

<p>There were rustlings in the jungle, but no
native dared show himself.</p>

<p>“Tell them, Baderoon, that white men are
peaceful—when let alone. Also, that the
white man will not harm any chief if he will
step out and talk.”</p>

<p>Baderoon raised his voice, translating the
curator’s message. Absolute silence brooded
in the jungle.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” said the curator, and his
voice rang like iron, “that the white man
would be friends. But if they do not make
a talk at once he will bring down his thunders
and lightnings and utterly destroy this village,
their canoes, and their coconut palms.
I have spoken it.”</p>

<p>Baderoon translated, and at this a grizzled
old sinner with a white mop of woolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
hair stepped out trembling from behind a
tree.</p>

<p>“If the White Thunderer will only deign
not to utterly destroy <i>us</i>!” he croaked, shaking
all over as Baderoon translated.</p>

<p>“Ye shall call your old men to tow-tow;
and ye shall send runners to every village,
far and near, lest the thunders descend on
them also!” declared the curator, sternly.</p>

<p>“It is agreed,” said the old man, finally,
with shaking voice. “Only let the white
man not harm us further! Many warriors and
many canoes come not back because of him!”</p>

<p>He called into the forest and three other
old men came unwillingly forth. They advanced,
unarmed, to the edge of the clearing,
stooping down and pouring sand on their
heads in token of abject submission, but
that was as far as they could be coaxed to
come.</p>

<p>“It is well,” called the curator, at length,
for he had no wish to risk any undue familiarity
with them. “Shoot something, Sadok.
I want them to fear you, too.”</p>

<p>Sadok looked around for a mark, and his
eyes lit on a wandering pig under one of the
huts. He poised his sumpitan and the dart
flew out of its muzzle. The pig squealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and twitched his tail, and then went on rooting.
In another moment he sighed and laid
over, dead.</p>

<p>A shiver and a rustling of leaves ran through
the underbrush.</p>

<p>“Ye have seen the silent death, also,”
said Baderoon, raising his voice at the curator’s
prompting. “Do not eat the pig; it
is taboo.”</p>

<p>One of the old men took off his boars’-tusk
breastplate and stepped forward and laid it
on the ground. He testified that it was a
present. At a sign from the curator Baderoon
fetched it. The scientist examined it curiously.
The white tusks were laid in rows,
one atop the other, and their ends were
bound with fiber network, thickly ornamented
with polished red beads. The curator
started with astonishment as he looked
closely at them.</p>

<p>“Ask him where they get those red beads,
Baderoon.”</p>

<p>There was some talk and waving of arms,
and then Baderoon turned to the curator.
“Him get’m big mountain—down there,”
he said, pointing to the south. “Mus’ fight
litty hill men for him. Prenty too-much
trophy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Tell him the white man is pleased, and
will give a present, too.”</p>

<p>The curator undid his red-silk bandanna,
and Baderoon bore it over ceremoniously
and laid it before the chief. The latter
grinned, for the first time, and they could see
that he was dying to handle it. He nodded
at the curator with beaming eyes and made
the pantomime of rubbing noses.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” snorted the curator.
“That’s where the earlier explorers all lose
out! The natives soon find out we’re ordinary,
vulnerable human beings, if you let
them get too familiar. Tell him, Baderoon,
that the white man says to start his runners
at once, and never to touch another white
man so long as he lives! Farewell!”</p>

<p>He turned to go as Baderoon translated.
They walked back to the canoes and picked
out a small one, more easy to handle. Shoving
off, they paddled down the lagoon, the
curator sitting silently in the stern, for he
knew that curious eyes were watching him
from the jungle. A repressed eagerness shone
in his own as he still examined curiously the
boars’-tusk breastplate in his hands.</p>

<p>“Well—I guess that’ll hold ’em for a time—eh,
boys?” he smiled, raising his eyes from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
it at length when they had left the village
landing far behind. “And—I may have
something important to tell you after we
reach camp!”</p>

<p>“Some weapon, that air pistol of yours,
sir!” said Nicky, admiringly. “How did
you ever get such an idea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was just a hang-over from the
Western Front,” replied the curator. “I’ve
been through any number of trench scrimmages,
and I learned that it’s not the iron
casing of grenades that does the most mischief,
but the gas itself. It has far more
rending power than that cast-iron shell of
the grenade. Remember our old air guns of
boyhood? Well, I sent some sketches to the
factory and had them make me this pistol
on the same lines. These light nickel shells
of T. N. T. turned out to be as good as heavy
grenades when I tested them. All that is
needed is something to throw them with
accuracy, so I had this gun made and a lot
of shells, timed for eighty, fifty, and thirty
yards—which is about as close as you can be
to them with any safety. That’s all there
is to it. Beats the old dynamite stick that
they used to use on the savages of the South
Seas all hollow, I’ll say!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>They passed the floating wreckage of the
night before as he spoke, and everyone set
to work picking up paddles, spears, and
arrows, the latter sticking up out of water,
point down, like buoys. Then the curator
made a grab and hauled aboard a floating
shield. It was of the same long, oval type
that the war party had carried the day before,
and he examined the red paint in the carving
minutely with his magnifying glass.</p>

<p>“It’s the same mineral we found in Aru,
Dwight,” he declared, after a close scrutiny.
“Wait till we get to camp; I’ve got a fine
young idea hatching.”</p>

<p>That was all they could get out of him,
but the paddles swept on more tirelessly
than ever, for both boys were consumed with
curiosity over the new mineral.</p>

<p>At length they came to their own headland,
with the frowning ramparts of the mountains
looming back of them endlessly to the south.
Here was the mouth of their creek, and up
it they drove the canoe under the green
arches of the jungle. After a time it came
out at the old coral bank, and the abandoned
sail proa showed up ahead, its bow still on
the little beach. Sadok and Baderoon jumped
ashore and set about getting their fire started,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
while the boys dove for their provision sacks,
for they had had nothing to eat for twenty-four
hours and were famished.</p>

<p>But the curator could not wait. He cut off
a sliver from the red mineral paint in the
shield scrolls and scraped a portion of it into
a small test tube which he got out of his mess
kit. Filling it with a little water, he went
over to Nicky’s alcohol flame and brought
it to a boil. Then he opened a tiny bottle
of acid and dropped a tear of it into the
test tube.</p>

<p>“Gad! boys!” he whooped. “What do
you think of <i>that</i>?” he cried, holding up the
tube, now filled with a cloudy yellow precipitate.
“Remember that red stone we
got in the channels of Aru, Dwight? Well,
this is the same mineral, <i>cinnabar</i>, red oxide of
mercury, boys! If there’s a mountain of it,
as these natives tell us, back in the hills,
we’ve <i>got</i> to find it, for, once it is reported, it
will change the whole history of this part of
New Guinea. The stuff is worth its weight
in gold!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Exploration!” mumbled
Nicky, his mouth stuffed with food. “Have
some, Professor!”</p>

<small>CASSOWARY CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“BADEROON, how call-him that place
chief-fellah get red paint?” asked the
curator, turning to Baderoon from the test
tube in his hand.</p>

<p>“Red Mountain!” said Baderoon, promptly.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” ejaculated the curator.
“There can’t be a whole mountain of cinnabar,
you know! Why, you could buy out
the United States Treasury with it! Might
be a stratum of it—but, no; ‘<i>Red</i>’ Mountain!
If there’s enough of the ore in sight to give
it that name, it’s something we’ve got to see
and report. Everything else is insignificant
compared to this, boys!” he exulted. “I
discovered a mountain once, in Mexico, near
the top of which was a thick vein of cinnabar.
Some day they’ll run a railroad in there and
get it out, it’s so valuable. But a whole
mountain of it, and right handy to the sea!
Why, man, it’ll make Holland the queen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
the world again! Think how the world’s
mercury is hoarded, for making fulminate,
for every primer and every shell fuse that is
shot!” he went on, excitedly. “Think of
the explosives possible, with unlimited supplies
of mercury. T. N. T. isn’t in it, compared
with some of the fulminates! The Japs
won the Russian war with their new camphor
shell, but their supply of camphor is limited.
Some day there will be a big war over Red
Mountain, take it from me!”</p>

<p>“’Ray for Exploration!” crowed Dwight.
“Come on, Mr. Baldwin; here’s some nice
wallaby steak!”</p>

<p>The curator grinned as he came back to
earth and bit into the succulent meat. “Just
the same, boys, we’re going to see that mountain,
or die in the attempt. The only thing
that worries me is how to handle the pygmies.
It’s right in their country, and we’ll have to
wade through them to get there. They were
peaceable enough with the English expedition,
but that was only because they were
afraid to start anything. They’re always at
war with the Papuans, and there’s a sort of
no-man’s land between the jungle and the
foothills which cannot be crossed by either
side without a fight. However, the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
thing for us to do is to jerk the rest of this
wallaby meat and each man carry along a
bag of pemmican made of it.”</p>

<p>They erected a pole jerky frame that afternoon,
and started a small drying fire under
it, with long strips of the meat hanging in
rows from the poles. Under the hot tropical
sun the drying process went on apace, and
soon the strips had become hard sticks of
meat, greasy to the touch, hard and fibrous
as wood. Steadily, also, the collections grew
larger, box after box being filled with Dwight’s
insects, Nicky’s reptiles, and the curator’s
birds, while their big tin of bird skins was
filled up and sealed. This main collection
was to be a representative one of the whole
region, after which only the rarer specimens
need be sought for. On the third day the
crate of collections boxes was cached, well
hidden in a coral cave dug in the thickets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sadok set about replenishing
his supply of poisoned arrows, as his quiver
of them had run low. He cut a quantity of
the long thorns of the sago palm, and near
the bottom of each he lashed a little cone of
the corklike bark, so that it would just fit in
the bore of the sumpitan, which was about
three eighths of an inch in diameter. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
poisoning the points he had a supply of the
gummy juice of the upas tree, brought from
Borneo and carefully kept in a small bamboo
bottle which hung on his belt.</p>

<p>Sadok was grouched. A faint but noisesome
odor came from somewhere in the jungle,
where his three heads were drying, but
here, look you, had been two fights with the
Outanatas since, and never a head for his
personal collection! He was comforted, however,
by the curator telling him that the
upas vine, or some other representative of the
strychnine family, grew in New Guinea, also,
and that there would be plenty of ructions
before he ever saw Borneo again.</p>

<p>Their stay at this camp had given them
not only a fair idea of the general features
of the country, but of the weather as well.
Under the west monsoon, its daily changes
were as regular as clockwork. A fine cool
dawn, followed by several hours of misty
and clearing weather when it was good to
be up and doing; then the heat of midday,
when even the jungle people knew enough
to take a siesta; and then, about four o’clock,
a tropical thunderstorm of the utmost violence,
lasting until eight at night, when the
sky cleared off. They soon learned to plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
their day according to these weather changes,
and at length the party broke camp for the
long trek into the mountains. They followed
much the same trail as before, to the
table-lands along the mountain flank, and
stopped for lunch on the pebbly site of their
capture by the war party of the Outanatas
of the week before.</p>

<p>But with what different feelings now!
Then the fear of the unknown, the dread of
meeting cannibal savages who would surely
regard them as but strangers to be killed and
eaten at sight. Now a feeling of confidence
replaced all that. They had established
the superiority of the white man in all that
region, the respect in the native mind that
is based only on superior force. Not even
a native runner had dared show his face
since that punitive expedition of the curator’s.
They even felt confident to hunt
singly, not too far from the main party.
While the others were settling down for the
noonday siesta in the heat of midday, Dwight
spied a flash of brilliant orange in the greens
of the jungle across the creek, and set out
alone after the bird, shotgun in hand. The
orange spot flew off into the jungle as he
drew near it, but Dwight had caught a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
glimpse of black-velvet plumage, and that
flaming fire of orange on the throat, which
made him tingle all over with the thrill that
it <i>might</i> be the exceedingly rare six-shafted
bird of paradise! He followed on through
the jungle, his eyes fixed on that small dot
of black perched far ahead, high in the tree
tops. Moving as cautiously as he could,
he worked through the festooned creepers
and the huge boles of giant jungle trees
toward his prize. But to his chagrin, it
flew off again, just as he was about to try
the spiteful little twenty-gauge at long range.</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes followed the bird avidly.
To bring back a six-shafter! Why, all this
expedition had been for just such a prize
as this! Nothing is known of this bird save
what can be conjectured from the few skins
now in the world’s museums. To add one
more to that meager collection, each specimen
with who knows what story of adventure
and privation behind it, seemed to
Dwight a corking enterprise. Using all the
woodcraft he possessed, he worked silently
through the jungle. Experience had taught
him to look ahead for a place to plant each
footstep, not only to be sure that one did
not step on a snake, but also to insure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
foot coming down in position to fire instantly.
With gun muzzle up, he advanced carefully,
praying earnestly that his quarry might
linger just a few minutes more.</p>

<p>Again the paradise bird fluttered off, and
this time Dwight had but a line on where
he had gone, for the last glimpse of him disappeared
through the jungle, far off through
the tree trunks. He groaned with disappointment,
but he was not the boy to give
up while there was a ghost of a chance left.
Fixing on a tall Erythrina as the last tree
past which the bird had soared, he set out
as fast as possible. In perhaps half an hour
he reached the tree, and, taking the range,
set out again, his eyes scrutinizing the leafy
foliage of the jungle roof. He had about
begun to lose hope now, and, moreover, to
realize that he was totally lost in the jungle,
far from his companions, when a flutter of
wings some distance ahead showed him his
siren bird, flitting about and feeding on
clusters of blue tropical berries that hung
in the foliage of a high tree top that loomed
up ahead.</p>

<p>Dwight heaved a sigh of relief. The bird
would surely stay there, feeding, and he had
plenty of time for a careful stalk. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
wormed through the jungle, and at last
arrived where an aim could be had, at not
more than forty yards. Raising the gun
carefully, he fired, and down came his prize,
at last!</p>

<p>It was with a sort of breathless wonder
that Dwight looked over the six-shafted
bird of paradise as he lifted it gently out of
the dense undergrowth in which it had fallen.
<i>Why</i> did nature lavish such abundant beauty
on a bird destined never to be seen by eyes
that could appreciate it? Human eyes, that
is, for, of course, the bird would be forever
a delight to the eyes of that dull-colored
little mate of his whose protection demanded
something less gorgeously visible. It made
him feel how insignificant is man in nature’s
world. Man, the animal, as exhibited by
the naked savages who inhabited this forest
was Nature’s own child; assuredly this bird
was not so decorated to please him! Man,
the intellectual, civilized man, could feel a
thrill of rapture over this creature of Nature’s,
admire its intense golden-orange throat scales,
its rich, velvety, purple-black plumage, its
crown of vivid emerald and topaz colors,
with the long wire-haired plumes springing
back like a coronet from its head; but Nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
cared nothing for intellectual man and his
mind, which was not of her doing, and she
certainly did not make this bird for him!
In fact, we are each one of us two people,
Dwight philosophized, amusing himself with
these fancies as he examined the paradise
bird in his hand—man the animal, the
creature of Nature, living very like the animals
themselves and dependent on her, like
them; and man, the intellectual, a creature
of a power that is above Nature, the Being
from whom sprang art, religion, philosophy,
science, all the things that are above Nature
and essentially antagonistic to her. But
in the end Nature always has her revenge,
for her jungles reclaim proud cities, as in
India and Central America, or her deserts
isolate them, as Athens and the Parthenon,
or her sands bury them, like Egypt and the
Sphinx.</p>

<p>“All that sermon from one small tropical
bird!” laughed Dwight to himself, carelessly,
as his thoughts came back to earth again.
“Nature may be irreconcilably hostile to
us—but, where am I now, and how am I
going to get out? That’s the real question
for <i>this</i> man!”</p>

<p>He had no idea how or where his wanderings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
in pursuit of the paradise bird had taken
him. All that was certain was that he had
not crossed the creek again, and that he was
somewhere east of it. He laid a course west
with the compass, and set out, confident that
he would sooner or later strike the stream.</p>

<p>But Nature proceeded to show him how
utterly insignificant to her is man. The
first indication of it was a large plop of her
tropical rain which fell on his helmet. Dwight
looked up, surprised to see the sky overcast
and the thunders of the daily afternoon
tropical storm muttering in the mountains.
He must have been several hours following
this six-shafter! He hurried on back toward
the creek, stumbling through the jungle and
striving to stifle panicky impulses to run.
It was essential to keep his head, and to
pick out landmark trees, methodically, ahead
on his course, for you cannot steer yourself
like a ship with the compass in the jungle.
He forced his attention upon this, ignoring
the raindrops, the steady patter of which
kept up in the tree tops. The wetted undergrowth
soon soaked his thin khaki. He
now bitterly regretted setting out without
his pack. Just a moment to have shouldered
it would have been enough, but he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
too eager, too afraid to lose sight of his
precious prize.</p>

<p>A distant roar of wind, and an angry cannonade
of thunder came from the west,
setting the jungle to rocking and tossing
overhead, while birds flew wildly through
the tree tops, croaking and screeching harshly.
Dwight stopped and listened to it. He was
trembling all over with the wet cold, and
sharp chills were running through him. Now
or never was the time for a signal, for no
sound would carry far after the rain came.
He raised his gun, fired both barrels, and
listened with all his ears.</p>

<p>No answer, save the roar of the rain,
sounding louder and louder and coming
nearer and nearer. He looked about for
the largest tree near him and ran for it.
The branches of wind-lashed forest were now
parting overhead, and out of the dark gray
came vivid flashes of lightning which filled the
jungle with winking light. The long ropes of
creepers which climbed up to the branches of
his tree from the jungle floor swung solemnly
in the wind, and Dwight crept under them
and huddled close against the trunk, cowering
in the buttresses of the great roots.</p>

<p>Then came the rain, in furious white sheets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
that filled the forest with a flying haze. It
soaked him instantly to the skin, while peal
after peal of thunder went off like cannon
shots. An ungovernable terror seized the
boy—the fury of the wind-driven rain, the
loneliness, the crashing and riving of limbs
and branches—and he lifted up his voice in
one last, despairing yell with every ounce of
lung power that he possessed.</p>

<p>There was no answer—save a low, sibilant
hiss, which sounded through the lowering
gloom, close at hand, whispering sharp and
clear in his ears above the noise of the storm!
Dwight, startled with a shiver of fright,
looked up, to perceive that one of the great
vines overhead was <i>not</i> a creeper, but a huge
python, lowering himself steadily, his neck
crooked, and his head drawn back to strike
at him! His gun flashed to shoulder, and
both barrels went off blindly as the boy’s
nerves collapsed with the shock of horror
and he sank down in a shivering heap. He
had a dim feeling of yards and yards of snake
tumbling down through the vines beside
him, but he seemed not to care about it at
all, for it was comfortable down here between
these roots ... if he could only find a place
for his head....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>When he came to it was pitch dark and
the storm had gone on. A scampering of
jungle rats made off through the black as
Dwight moved his cramped limbs wearily,
to find them aching all over and his face hot
and flushed with fever, while violent chills
kept running upward through his body.</p>

<p>He peered about him, bewildered; then
conscious ideas began to pelt in upon him.</p>

<p>“F-f-fire! Quick-ick as I can m-make
one!” he chattered to himself, fumbling for
his pocket flasher. Its small but brilliant
light lit up the jungle, causing many an
outcry of night birds and a scurrying over
the forest floor of land crabs and small marsupials.
It also revealed the tumbled heap
of the python lying beside him, its neck shot
in two and parts of its reticulated length
already gnawed by rodents. He glanced at
it casually; to get wood that would burn
was the real worry now! the jungle was
black as a pocket, and a wan mist hung
through it. After one flash of the light on
those miasmas, drifting like pale death through
the trees, Dwight hurriedly got out his medicine
kit and swallowed some quinine. Then
he sought kindlings in the underbrush, breaking
twigs here and there, but they were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
sodden and moldy. He felt sick all over and
burning with fever, and he wanted to lie
down again and sleep forever; but it was
most imperative to stay alive, so he started
off through the jungle in search of firewood,
stumbling westward by compass, until a
great tangle of vines ahead of him told of a
prone dead tree.</p>

<p>His spirits rose as his eye lit on it, and he
pushed his way under the great bole with
ready shotgun, for he could not tell how
many jungle dwellers might have camped
under it during the storm. A grand scampering
and creeping rustled the dry leaves
under the trunk, but it soon stopped and the
flashlight showed the cavelike space all clear.
Dwight shouldered his way into it, and at
once cleared a space for a fire and began
peeling off strips of dry bark from the under
side of the tree. Blessed, blessed fire! The
one human thing in all this dark jungle!
That was the turning point in his mental
distress, for dejection gave way to cheerfulness,
wandering homelessness to a hearth
and a campfire. Soon the warmth of its
small blaze penetrated even his chilled bones,
and it and the quinine gradually drove off
his fever. Dwight waited out the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
under the trunk, trying the cave man’s
posture of sleep, squatting on his hams with
his head resting on arms crossed over his
knees (still used by the hill men of India
and by many tribes of the Malay Archipelago).
He found it not so bad, even
though irksome to a white man’s heel tendon.
Keeping the fire going with bark and small
branches broken from the tree trunk, he
gradually dried out, and at length there
came the dawn of another day and the jungle
awoke to life.</p>

<p>Starting off by compass again, he steered
due west, bound in time to strike the brook.
It was not for an hour more of traveling that
the jungle began to lighten on ahead, and
bits of sky, glimpses of mountain side, and
the tops of low trees told him he was coming
to where the brook skirted the plateau.
Dense, thorny underbrush began to block
his way now, and beyond it came the rippling
murmur of the stream. He shouted for the
curator and his party, hoping that he was
near enough to camp for his voice to be
heard. No answer came, except the sough
of the wind over the grasses and bushes of
the plateau, so Dwight decided to get out
into the open and study the mountains for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
something familiar. He forced his way to
the stream-side and jumped across.</p>

<p>He discovered, from the familiar headlands
of the mountain chain, that he was
some distance above camp. It seemed well
to fire another signal in the open, and he
was about to do so when three large birds
as big as ostriches jumped from the grass
in the swales and began to run, making a
scraping, cackling noise something like the
wild brush turkey.</p>

<p>“Cassowaries!” exclaimed Dwight, thrilling
with adventure again as his gun sprang to
shoulder. They were running like deer, their
red, wattled heads and bright-blue necks
stretched out ahead like giant chickens.
His shotgun held only sixes, so Dwight aimed
for the speeding head of the nearest cassowary
as at a flying quail, swinging ahead and
firing like a wing shot.</p>

<p>The cassowary went down, while the other
two flapped off in a wild burst of speed, using
their wings to aid their legs. Dwight rushed
out, intending to finish off his bird with the
knife, as he did not wish to injure the skin
of the specimen with a close-up shot. The
great bird lay in the grass as he came up,
its fiery eye looking at him, unconquered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
like a rooster that has been worsted in a
fight. As he rushed up it flew at him, squawking
discordantly. Dwight beat him off with
the barrels of his gun. The air seemed full
of the great black wings of his adversary,
blinding him with blows of the coarse, double-quilled
pinions. It never occurred to him
that a cassowary could be really dangerous,
and he laughed confidently as the heavy bird
fell to the ground and prepared to spring
again. With the second leap its long blue
neck lunged out and its blunt bill caught his
shirt collar and held on like a snapping turtle,
while its stout legs drummed fiercely on his
chest. Dwight felt the canvas of his coat
being ripped, and then a sharp pain seared
down his breast to the belt like a hot iron.
He was now fighting off the cassowary desperately,
stabbing blindly, and warding off
the blows of the wings on his head with his
left arm. The tearing and rending of its legs
on his chest kept up with increasing violence,
and he was forced to bring his elbows in close
to protect his stomach, dropping his knife
and grabbing with his hands at the stout feet
of the cassowary—anything to prevent being
disemboweled!</p>

<p class="caption">THEN A SHIVER WENT THROUGH THE BIRD, ITS EYES<br> FLUTTERED
CLOSED, AND THE GRIP OF ITS BILL<br> LOOSENED, WHILE THE BOY TUGGED
HIMSELF FREE</p>

<p>Then a shiver went through the bird, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
eyes fluttered closed, and the grip of its bill
loosened, while the boy tugged himself free.
He jumped for his knife in a battling rage,
intending to close in and finish his adversary,
who was now kicking feebly, when he heard
a shout, and turned to see Sadok and the
curator come running across the swales. A
sumpitan dart sticking in the bird’s side
told all!</p>

<p>“Did he hurt you?” yelled the curator,
sprinting toward him. “Don’t ever go near
a wounded cassowary, you darn fool!” he
exploded, wrathfully, as he came up. “Don’t
you know they’re more dangerous than a
kangaroo? Look!”</p>

<p>He stooped and held up the bird’s claw.
On the inside toe was a long hooked talon,
curved and sharp as a tiger’s claw.</p>

<p>“Did he get you with it?” demanded the
curator, looking at him anxiously, for Dwight
still stood looking at him, speechless, holding
to his chest with his left hand.</p>

<p>“Guess he did!” gasped the boy, swaying
weakly. He lifted his hand and his fingers
ran red with blood.</p>

<p>“Catch him, Sadok!” warned the curator
as his own hand dove for the first-aid in his
hip pocket. Dwight leaned against Sadok’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
strong shoulder, while the curator opened
his shirt and examined the wound hastily.
Two long gashes in his chest bled rather
freely, but nothing serious had been cut.</p>

<p>“Lucky for you, son! He’d have ripped
you open just as nice! Lots of new-chums
have been killed that way!” said the curator,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Lie down awhile; you’ll feel better presently,”
he ordered, for Dwight was white as
a sheet. “But, congratulations, boy, first
of all, on your getting back to us! I had not
time to say so, you know, in the excitement
of this ruction,” he apologized. “We’ll have
to hunt in pairs in the future. Where have
you been, Dwight, and why did you stay
out all night?”</p>

<p>“It was worth it!” smiled the boy, feebly,
and he dug into his coat pocket and brought
out the six-shafted bird of paradise, carefully
swathed in his handkerchief.</p>

<p>The curator undid the fastenings; then a
whoop of joy escaped him.</p>

<p>“Boy!” he beamed, reaching forward to
shake Dwight’s hand again. “It sure <i>was</i>
worth it! Man, it’s the big prize of the expedition—so
far!”</p>

<p>He and Sadok then fired shots and called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
until they brought Nicky and Baderoon out
of the jungle. Nicky came up on the run.</p>

<p>“Where’s Dwight? What’s happened?” he
cried, anxiously; then, catching sight of
Dwight: “You—old—hatrack!” he burbled,
flinging himself affectionately on his chum.
“Say, the whole camp was worrying about
you and firing guns, last night! Get lost
in the jungle?”</p>

<p>“Nope. He got—this!” cut in the curator,
holding up the flaming glories of the paradise
bird for Nicky to admire. “And then—a
cassowary tried to scrape an acquaintance
with him, so to speak!” He laughed, pointing
out the huge bird lying in the grass, with
Sadok working over his skin.</p>

<p>“And, b’lieve me, your li’l’ old dart got
there just in time!” chirped Dwight from the
grass. “Shake, Sadok!”</p>

<p>“Make a stretcher out of a couple of coats
and two poles, boys!” ordered the curator,
energetically, as Sadok finished the cassowary
skin with a grunt of satisfaction. “We
four’ll tote him to camp. How about Camp
Cassowary for a name for this stop, hey,
boys?”</p>

<small>PYGMY LAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“THIS is not an expedition—it’s getting
to be a hospital!” exclaimed the curator,
whimsically, as Dwight was tucked away
under his own tent fly. “Baderoon’s arm
is still game, and Dwight will be at least three
days getting healed up—yet. Did you ever
see such glorious country to move about in,
or such wonderful weather?”</p>

<p>Nicky agreed with him. He had collected
in British Guiana and the West Indies, yet
this was the first time he had been free of the
eternal green maze of the deep jungle. Up
here, high on the mountain flanks, it was hot
and dry, and the vegetation was more like
the open African veldt. Across the creek,
to the east, and down into the lowlands,
swept the damp jungle; back of camp, to
the west, rose the mountain sides, inviting
them irresistibly to climb up and see what
might be seen from their tops.</p>

<p>Dwight’s adventure with the cassowary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
had upset their plans badly. There was no
telling how soon he could move, for wounds
in the tropics have an aggravating way of
infecting and becoming obstinate about healing.
The curator chafed over the delay,
scarce daring to hope that the dry, breezy
climate of the mountains would bring a swift
closing of the scratches of the cassowary’s
claw. He considered, meanwhile, the advisability
of setting out with Nicky on a scouting
tour, leaving Sadok and Baderoon to
guard the camp. He finally decided to risk
a day’s absence.</p>

<p>“Dwight,” said he, coming over to the
boy’s tent after making up his mind, “Nicky
and I are going to climb this mountain back
of us, and do some mapping and exploring
from its top. We’ll be gone all day, and
possibly the night, too. It’s taking a chance,
to break up our party this way, I know, but
half our time has already gone by since the
proa left, and we must be up and doing. I’m
leaving you the most deadly weapon I’ve
got.” He pulled out a bright, shiny, nickel
bomb from a flap case on his belt. It seemed
very light and fragile to Dwight as he handled
it.</p>

<p>“I call it the ‘explorer’s bomb,’” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
curator. “It’s filled with H. E. explosive.
To arm it you bend this little copper projection
over until it breaks off and you hear
a hiss. Then throw it for all you’re worth
and run! If a war party comes up, and they
won’t keep their distance or act hostile,
throw it among them, and then you and
the others bolt for cover.” He unbelted the
bomb’s carrying case, and Dwight replaced
the missile in it gingerly. “You won’t have
to use it, I’m sure,” said the curator, confidently.
“Between the <i>lakatoi</i> and the canoe
fight we’ve got a reputation for being best
left alone, in this region, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>He and Nicky set off early next morning.
They went straight up the mountain side
through the thick and thorny jungle. The
geological formation was of comparatively
recent lava rock, and the regular slope signified
that an old extinct volcano crater
formed its top, no doubt long since filled up
and overgrown. As they climbed steadily
higher, and wider and wider vistas of the
country came to view, this impression was
confirmed. High up on the slopes a regular
talus of broken lava rock from some former
eruption barred their way. The bowlders
were of all sizes and their crevices and sunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
flats held many a snake, so that Nicky, as
“snakeologist” of the expedition, felt constrained
to cut a snake stick and go after
them.</p>

<p>The curator lit his pipe and sat down to
spy out the country, meanwhile, with his
glasses. Presently Nicky passed him, carrying
a long stick of lignum-vitæ with a length
of string tied to its top. Just under it he
had nailed a staple with the string looped
through it. Nicky stalked along, jumping
from rock to rock, his eyes intent below him.
Presently he made a quick jab with the
stick, pulled tight on the string, and then
bore aloft a squirming red-and-black serpent,
vainly winding itself around the end of the
stick, while its head struck futilely at the
empty air.</p>

<p>“<i>Elaterus wallacei</i>—deadly poisonous,” announced
Nicky, scientifically, holding up the
creature for the curator to admire. “Isn’t
he a beauty?”</p>

<p>“Handsome!” agreed the curator, laughingly.
“Not <i>quite</i> so near, Nick—and I
hope you’ve got tight hold of that string!”</p>

<p>“Sure! Watch me make a specimen of
him!” said the enthusiast, picking up a small
club. He held the end of the snake stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
down on a rock, where a few judgmatical
raps reduced his captive to a scientific
curiosity.</p>

<p>Nicky dropped him in a small canvas bag
which was pretty sure to have a few lizards
and frogs and turtles in it, also, at any given
time of day, and they set out upward again.
A wide belt of century plants barred their
way as they climbed higher. They grew in
rank profusion, the great green leaves crossing
in every direction, six feet high, and all
armed with a dagger point at the tip and
saw teeth along the blades. A man’s eyes
would be worth nothing if he once got himself
well into them.</p>

<p>A detour of about a mile brought them
around the century plants, and then came
lava escarpments, steep and difficult to climb.
Up them they swarmed, and found themselves
on a gradually rising, arid table-land with
sparse vegetation growing all about, and
magnificent views out in every direction.</p>

<p>Working southward, they finally came out
on a bald knob that the curator had noted
from the camp below and had determined to
reach. Here the view was superb, wonderful—when
you came to consider that all you
looked at below was new and unmapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
country. The curator’s pocket aneroid gave
their height at a little over six thousand feet.
Far over to the east could be made out the
dim outlines of Geelvink Bay, with the
limitless Pacific behind it. Below them, to
the west, the slopes ran down sharply to the
mangrove swamps that lined the shores
fronting on the Banda Sea, with the long
point of Cape Debelle jutting out as if on a
small relief map directly below them.
Beyond it, far over the sea, a bank of clouds
on the horizon told them of Aru, a hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>But it was to the south that their eyes
turned with the most inquiring interest.
Here the ranges rose higher and higher, under
heavy banks of clouds, until, on the extreme
horizon, the sun glinted on a white, snowy
sea of mountains, jagged with peaks and
caps, with Carstensz (17,000 feet) just visible
as a tiny jutting point of white. Two hundred
years ago Jan Carstensz, navigating
along these shores, caught a glimpse of the
Snow Mountains from the decks of his vessel
and reported them in the ship’s log. It was
such a rare glimpse, behind the eternal veil
of clouds that shrouds the interior of New
Guinea, that no one believed him. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
that day to this, a lifting of the jungle clouds
hanging low over the mountains, and the
white man present to see them, have never
come at the same time, so that even the
existence of the high fellows in the interior
has been regarded as a wild tale of Jan Carstensz.
It was not for more than two centuries
later, in 1911, that Jan Lorentz, another
intrepid Hollander, with a party of twenty
Dyaks, made a dash through the pygmy
country and ascended the first one of the
Snow Mountains, naming it Mt. Wilhelmina
in honor of the Dutch queen.</p>

<p>From their own knob another wonderful
feature of the country could also be seen,
extending southward in a long flat perspective—the
Great Precipice. For two hundred
miles this precipice extends like a rampart,
dividing the mountains from the flat jungle.
It rises sometimes to a sheer height of ten
thousand feet, undoubtedly the grandest precipice
in the world. Sloping up to it, they
could make out the jungle-clad talus, and
beyond that the lowlands of the river country,
widening out more and more as the coast
land flowed southward. Dozens of rivers,
they knew, cut through this jungle, out of
sight in the green sea of foliage, and here was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the scene of the English expedition, their
party arriving full of hope and confidence,
only to be baffled by the precipice and the
swift floods of the rivers from getting farther
than the foothills of the Snow Mountains.
Here they had discovered the race of pygmies,
and had visited one of their villages, collected
implements of war and domestic usage,
and, most valuable of all, a list of some fourteen
words in their tongue, now carefully
preserved for future use in the curator’s
notebook.</p>

<p>“Nicky,” said the curator, after a long
and careful examination of a spot on the
jungly hills to the south of them, “I wish
you would take a look at that scar over yonder,
where a sort of ravine seems to run down
the second mountain to the south of us. My
eyes may be deceiving me, but—” He handed
over the glasses.</p>

<p>Nicky looked eagerly, with his fresh young
eyes glued to the binoculars.</p>

<p>“Huts! Little huts, ’way up in the tree
tops! I’m sure of it!” he cried, after a
careful scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” said the curator, quietly.
“Those huts up in the tree tops are where
the unmarried girls of the pygmy tribes sleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
That marks it as a pygmy village. See if
you can’t make out larger huts on the ground.”</p>

<p>Nicky studied the jungle awhile, with
intense concentration. “I see them,” he
cried, handing the curator the glasses. “The
small huts are built up in bare pandanus
trees, and under the palms and bamboos
around them I can see a brown shape like a
bear’s back—that’s a thatched hut.”</p>

<p>Baldwin agreed with him, after a look for
himself. Together they planned a route to
reach the village in about two days’ march.</p>

<p>“Say, Mr. Baldwin, that war party of the
Outanatas was on its way for a fight with
<i>them</i>, when they came upon us—that’s my
hunch!” declared Nicky, with sudden conviction.</p>

<p>“No doubt! There’s probably more or
less of an old trail, if we look for it. And
now for some plane-table surveys, Nicky.”</p>

<p>The curator unfolded a large blank sheet
among the rear pages of his notebook, and
on it drew a rough map of the country, with
Nicky to help with comment and suggestion.
Then out of his mess kit he took a flat, round
brass box, which turned out to be a compass
with folding sight bars. With this compass,
bearing sights were taken of all the prominent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
peaks and hills in sight, and the map was
then corrected to agree with the bearings.</p>

<p>Then the curator indicated a tall banyan
tree growing on the end of a spur of the
mountain opposite to them to the south.</p>

<p>“See that tree, Nick?” he asked. “We’ll
climb up there to-morrow, and take all these
bearings again from that point. Where they
intersect these we have taken from here will
be the true positions of all these interior peaks
and valleys on our maps. That’s the way
we make an accurate plane-table survey.”</p>

<p>“How about the distance from here to the
banyan tree as a base line?” objected Nicky.
“How’ll we lay that out on the map? We
don’t know it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll measure it, son. We’ll lay off a
base line down in those open swales where
the cassowary got his Dwight, so to speak,
and we’ll sight this knob and the banyan
tree, both, from below. With a known base,
and the two triangles erected on it by bearing
angles, it’s a cinch to calculate the distance
from this knob to the banyan.”</p>

<p>They descended the mountain to camp,
finding Dwight up and about and puttering
around his camp, an occupation he dearly
loved. Baderoon was loafing to his heart’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
content, and Sadok had succeeded in adding
a rare black cockatoo to the collections.
That evening Nicky and the curator went
into the open and measured off a base line.
From both ends of it their mountain knob
and the banyan tree on the next mountain
to the south could be sighted. The compass
was set up on a stake, and the bearings of
both points carefully taken from each end
of the base line. It was dark when they got
through.</p>

<p>After the camp had fed for the night, the
curator came over to Nicky’s fly and squatted
there, with his notebook spread out. He
first laid off their base line in a small number
of the blue-line squares on a page of the notebook.
From the ends of this he drew the
angles they had taken with the compass.
They formed two thin, wedge-shaped triangles,
slanting away from the base line in
opposite directions. Counting the blue
squares between the outer points of these
two triangles gave the distance between the
knob and the banyan tree compared with the
base line, from which it was easy to figure
the actual distance. Laying this out on his
map, they were ready for the climb next
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>It did not seem possible to Nicky that they
could climb up a new mountain, clear up to
that banyan tree, without a series of hair-raising
adventures, but, strange to say, it
was done! The boy began to study out this
phenomenon, finally, so unusual did it seem,
and he found the secret of it lay in the curator’s
method. He was after a plane-table
survey, now, and so he let all the wild creatures
alone—and they let him alone! Cassowaries
and brush turkeys ran off, squawking cackles
through the swales of saw grass, but the
curator heeded them not. Wallabys leapt
for cover, and were let go free. They passed
a high pandanus with a tree kangaroo crawling
in its top, but no Nicky was detailed to
go up after him. Snakes of high and low
degree, fascinating in the extreme to Nicky,
went squirming on their ways unchased.
Even a cuscus of a new kind was passed by
unmolested. Nicky perceived that trouble
would not hunt you, if you did not seek it,
in the New Guinea jungle. In a surprisingly
short time they were at the foot of the banyan
tree and truing up all the points on the map
with intersecting lines drawn from their
position.</p>

<p>“Besides which, we have added a lot of stuff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
to the north which I can correct with coast
surveys,” concluded the curator as he folded
the pocket notebook. “I reckon this map
will admit me to the Royal Geographic and
entitle me to a whole alphabet tacked on after
my name—much that I care!” he laughed.
“The thing for us to do now is to push on
and visit the pygmies, and then for Cinnabar
Mountain! Sorry this survey did not show
it up. Must be farther on to the south.”</p>

<p>Next day camp was broken and the whole
party was on the move. Baderoon was
entirely well, now, and Dwight so far healed
that he and Sadok had overturned nearly
every rock near camp the day before, adding
hundreds of new beetles to his collection.
They followed at first the old war trail of the
Outanatas, and then, as it deviated away,
took the route planned out by Nicky and the
curator through the mountains from the
knob. That night the tents were pitched
on the edge of a warm, dry field of yellow
grass, with coco palms and wild, small-fruited
bananas crowding out into the clearing.
A little stream, flowing into their old
friend the creek, gave their roots the necessary
water, and made a rill to camp besides. It
all reminded Nicky and Dwight of some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
their earlier Florida camps with the curator,
and they felt entirely at home.</p>

<p>At dawn each man cooked him a breakfast,
rolled up his pack, and by sunup they were
on the trail again. From across the valley,
a look-see by Nicky up on the hillside disclosed
the pygmy village, now not half a
day’s march away, and they went along
cautiously, guns and pistols ready and the
curator’s air gun loaded with a short-range
shell, for they might come on a party of them
unexpectedly and no one could foresee the
outcome. About a mile from the village
they halted, and chose an easily defended
position on the mountain side. There they
waited for some of the pygmies to come that
way. There was a well-defined trail just
below them, and they judged that it was
often used. In perhaps an hour voices came
along it through the jungle. A small party,
of four warriors and a dog, were walking
single file along the path, and at sight of the
curator they all stopped with guttural exclamations
of alarm.</p>

<p>It seemed to Dwight that he had never
looked upon such villainous-looking little
men. They were about four feet six inches
high, the tallest not four feet nine; brownish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
black in color; and, instead of the Papuan
mop of frizzled hair, their heads were nearly
bald, with black chin and side whiskers, in
a sort of thick mane from ear to ear. They
carried bows at least a foot longer than they
were tall, spears, and a net bag slung over
the shoulder. Each man had also a small
sack containing his fire sticks and other
belongings slung about his neck. In place
of the usual loin cloth, or just plain nudity,
each wore a long, yellow half gourd, hung
from a string around his middle and secured
by a thong through the crotch.</p>

<p>Dwight thrilled to realize that he was
looking upon the original aborigines of New
Guinea. Like the Negritos of the Philippines,
and our own cave men forbears, they were
short, strong little men, with well-developed
muscles and stout legs, and they were in a
high state of hunting-tribe civilization, as
shown by the decency of the gourd, the
absence of barbaric ornament, and the efficient
hunter’s equipment that each man
carried. They did not seem particularly
afraid, but stood staring at the white party,
arrows on bow, ready for any eventuality.</p>

<p>The curator grinned and, pointing at the
mangy-looking dog, “<i>Wiwi!</i>” he pronounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>The four started with astonishment, to
hear a word in their own tongue spoken by
this strange-looking white man.</p>

<p>Then, pointing at the most clownish-looking
one of the four, “<i>Amare-ta?</i>” (“His?”) he
asked, smiling genially.</p>

<p>The man was evidently the butt and good
fellow of the crowd, for the shot about it being
<i>his</i> dog went home. A black-whiskered old
pirate, who was evidently their leader, cracked
a smile and nodded his head. Then they
began to chatter among themselves, excitedly.
Evidently they had heard of the English
expedition from their own tribes to the south.
The English had treated them well, experienced
as they are in handling natives.</p>

<p>“<i>Kami oro-ta?</i>” (“Your houses?”) asked
the curator, next. “Gosh! boys, I only
know fourteen words of their language, but
I’m working them for all they are worth!”
he exclaimed in an aside to their own party.</p>

<p>The pygmies grinned and nodded again,
dropping their arrow points in a more friendly
manner. He was winning them fast.</p>

<p>“<i>Kema-u-uteri!</i>” said the old fellow, vigorously,
pointing toward the village.</p>

<p>“He means they’re going to give us a pig
and some coconuts,” explained the curator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to his own party. “They want us to come
up to the village. I guess not! We’ll stay
right here and see what next.”</p>

<p>He nodded his thanks for their offer; then,
“<i>Area-ta ku!</i>” (“My boat!”) he said to the
pygmies, waving his hand toward the lagoon
down in the valleys. “<i>Uta doro-ta!</i>” he
added, pointing to their camp site, the words
telling them that his fire would be made
there.</p>

<p>The four nodded and grinned as the curator
signified politely that they were welcome to
visit him. Then they started up the trail,
with many a backward glance of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Now, then, boys, it’s up to us to barricade
this camp and make it as strong for
defense as we can, until we see how everything
turns out,” said the curator, energetically,
after they had gone.</p>

<p>The site was admirably chosen. A huge
prone bole lay across the front of it, overlooking
the trail, and it only needed stones cleared
away and piled on the flanks to make a veritable
fort of it, with their rear protected by
the rocky ledges of the mountain. They
cleared out the inclosure and then started
their fire. Presently yells and shouts and
an excited babel of voices came floating across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the valley from the village. Through the
glasses they could see men, women, and
children crowding around the four hunters,
and then there was an immense amount of
running around and preparations of some
sort going on in the village.</p>

<p>“The four were not on the war path, for
they carried no bamboo knives for head
hunting,” ruminated the curator. “Tapiros,
I suppose. Get a lot of wood for a big fire,”
he ordered. “We want plenty of light if
they come around to-night, so we can see
what we are doing.”</p>

<p>The noise in the village redoubled, and,
as night came down and the tents and hammocks
were slung, it seemed that every man,
woman, and child in it was coming to visit
them in a mob. A singing chorus of the
wild little hill men came marching toward
them through the jungle paths.</p>

<p>“That’s bad!” exclaimed the curator,
anxiously. “If there was only some way we
could show our power, without hurting them!
We can’t let a mob get to close quarters
with us.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ve got a scheme, sir,” ventured
Nicky. “There are a few flashlights in my
vest-pocket camera. Suppose I run out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
explode one in the path, about thirty yards
off?”</p>

<p>“Well—get it ready, anyhow,” hesitated
the curator. “They don’t seem to be hostile.
Dwight and Sadok will cover you, while I
will step out in front of the log and try to
act like a peaceable human being.”</p>

<p>The pygmies came on in a crowd through
the dark, torches here and there shining
through the bush. They did not seem to be
sending out flanking parties, which was reassuring,
and the main body came on down the
trail. Nicky dashed out, lit the fuse of his
flash, and had just gotten back to the tree
when it went off. A blinding glare lit up
the scene. It showed at least a hundred
pygmies diving frantically for cover. The
whites noted with relief that the men were
decorated with flowers and carried no arms.
A party bearing a pig trussed up on a pole
had suddenly set down their burden and
decamped.</p>

<p>“They’re friendly!” cried the curator,
relievedly. “I’d give a million dollars for
the word ‘friend’ in Tapiro!” Instead, he
put his hand over his heart and bowed his
thanks for the pig, like any after-dinner
orator. Sadok threw a pile of grass on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
fire and its flames lit up the scene. The
moment hung in the balance.</p>

<p>“Sing, boys!—something plaintive!—for
God’s sake, sing!” barked the curator, hastily.</p>

<p>On such sudden notice Nicky could think
of nothing but the old campfire ditty, “Sweet
Adeline.” He poured it out, at the top of
his voice, the others chiming in on the refrain.
All over the world, in lonely campfires from
the Arctic to the Equator, that plaintive song
has unburdened the hearts of hunters and
explorers, as a wolf bays the moon. It did
not fail them now. Where words lacked,
music got across. That remote something
in the plaintive chimes of “Adeline” that
satisfies the white hunter had reached over
into the souls of this tribe of the most ancient
of all hunters. One or two old men came
out, quaking, from their hiding places, the
leader of the original four one of them.</p>

<p>“<i>Yow-nata-u; kema-kema!</i>” he quavered,
indicating the pig.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” called out the curator, desperately.
“Go get him, Sadok and Baderoon.
We’ve got to do the polite. I never knew
music to fail with savages yet!”</p>

<p>They went down and carried the pig up
ceremoniously, while the curator kept on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
bowing his thanks. “Set it down in front
of our tree. I’ve got another idea,” he said,
as they brought the pig up. “Put another
of your flashes in front of the pig, Nicky, and
touch it off.”</p>

<p>Nicky lit the fuse, and the curator stood
over the pig, making what he hoped were
sufficiently impressive incantations over it.
Presently the flash went off, lighting up the
whole jungle with its lurid glare. In the
intense darkness that followed, the pig was
whisked over the log out of sight. By the
time sight returned to the eyes of the little
hill men it had disappeared.</p>

<p>“That ought to hold ’em for a bit!” said
the curator, out of the corner of his mouth.
“They call me <i>Yow-nata</i>, ‘sun maker,’ so a
miracle or two won’t do any harm. Got
any more ideas, boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got a good one!” came back
Dwight. “Let’s have your flasher, sir, and
yours, Nicky. They’re both powerful. Now,
then, have you got anything to give them, sir?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I’ve been saving a small bag of
beads for some such affair as this,” said the
curator, producing them from a pocket.</p>

<p>“All right. You walk out there with them,
and I’ll do my stunt,” chuckled Dwight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Thank the Lord, ‘bead’ is one of the
words the English got,” said the curator,
starting down to the trail.</p>

<p>“<i>Upou</i> [beads] <i>kema!</i> [give]” he called
out, holding out a handful of them and waving
it about. The old men crept forward warily.
As they came close to the curator, Dwight,
with the flashers held on both sides of his
eyes, flashed them on. The effect was weird
in the extreme. It looked as if he had two
fiery eyes, and the rays lit up the curator
and made the glass beads in his palm flash
like jewels. There was an instant dive by
the hill men into the brush again.</p>

<p>“<i>Amare upou kema! Amare upou kema!</i>
[I give you beads! I give you beads!] Come
out, you little devils!” he called, reassuringly,
while Dwight kept the rays turned on him
steadily.</p>

<p>It took a lot of coaxing, but finally the
same old fellow ventured forth again, trying
the effect of the light on himself gingerly.
He jumped back as Dwight turned his face
and swept the jungle, heads popping out of
sight like chipmunks as his “eyes” lit up the
jungle. Then the old man ventured out
again as the rays returned to the curator.
Foot by foot he drew near, with many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
questioning glance, and finally the curator
was able to drop a pile of beads in his hand.
He grunted with pleasure, and Baldwin
signed for the other to approach. He gave
a small pile to each, and then walked back
to the log.</p>

<p>“Switch ’em off, Dwight. You did fine!”
he exclaimed. “Now we’ll go about our
affairs and let ’em watch us for the present.
You keep guard, and if any of them venture
too near, just turn those eyes on them and
we’ve got ’em on the run.”</p>

<p>The tents were put up and candles and
lanterns lit, the pygmies watching every
move from the jungle depths. The curator
spent his time trying to talk to the old men,
who had gathered in the trail below their
log breastwork, and he finally attempted a
few words in the hated Papuan tongue. To
his surprise they knew considerable of that,
too, and Baderoon was at once called to interpret.
Between them a feast was arranged
next day in the village, and the information
conveyed that the white man would prefer
that the tribe go back to their village, now,
as it was time for sleep.</p>

<p>At this the older men gave an order (there
did not seem to be any central head chief)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and they all drifted slowly back, their voices
coming faintly out of the jungle, all talking
excitedly.</p>

<p>“And now, boys, we’ll call it a day!” said
the curator. “Looks as if they were going
to be friendly. Sadok, you stand watch
until those stars there”—indicating the
Southern Cross—“come over that mountain.
Then call me.”</p>

<p>The camp turned in, leaving Sadok on
guard by the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br>

<small>THE FIGHT AT THE CRATER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“FILL your canteens, boys!” ordered the
curator, as they finished breakfast next
morning, “and stow all this pig meat we can
carry, for our aim will be to get through with
this feast of the pygmies as soon as we can
and then push on south. Every man pack
his kit for marching order.”</p>

<p>Sadok had butchered the pig during his
night watch, and he and Baderoon each had
a ham ready for slinging. The camp reveled
in fresh pork chops, and then cut slices of the
forequarters for carrying in their pemmican
sacks.</p>

<p>Then they set out for the pygmy village,
weapons still ready in case of any treachery.
All of the men of the tribe were gathered
around a great fire, and a huge feast of roast
brush turkey, sago-palm bread, and yams
was set out, all ready to eat, but not a woman
or a child was in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“That’s all right,” reassured the curator,
as the others looked around questioningly.
“The English offered the pygmies any amount
of bribes for a single photograph of a woman,
but they had all been moved up on the mountain
and no amount of persuasion could get
them to call one down. It means nothing
hostile to us.”</p>

<p>They seated themselves in the circle. The
pygmy men carried no arms, but they could
see weapons stacked against the trees near
by, among them the thin, flat blades of the
sinister bamboo knives used in head hunting.
The feast went on merrily, the curator working
out a system of learning pygmy words by
pointing at objects and making the question
sign. Speaking mixed Papuan and pygmy,
a considerable conversation was being carried
on. He managed to convey the idea that
birds and insects were exchangeable for more
of the beads, and then, finally, after a good
deal of groping—</p>

<p>“Him want you-fellah stop prenty much
time here,” explained Baderoon out of the
tangle of words and signs.</p>

<p>The curator shook his head and pointed
southward, smiling. Instantly an angry look
shot across the faces of the older men. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
shook their heads vigorously, and some halting
Papuan dialect followed.</p>

<p>“Him say taboo. Prenty debbil-debbil
mountain thataway,” translated Baderoon.
“No good. Prenty hantus. Must go back!”
He pointed north.</p>

<p>The curator smiled. “Yes, we will—not!
We might go back and circle around them,
fellows—but, no, they’ll have scouts spying
on us until we get out of the country, and
it’ll be a jungle fight all the way to try to
get past them to the south. No; we’ll have
it out with them now!”</p>

<p>“Tell them,” he said, sternly, “that the
<i>Yow-nata</i> is not afraid of any devil-devil, nor
taboo, nor hantus.”</p>

<p>An angry buzz greeted Baderoon’s translation.
The little black-bearded men shook
their heads violently, and some of them began
to look around for their weapons. There
were at least forty in the party.</p>

<p>“Looks like a close-up!” muttered the
curator, fumbling for his explosive bomb.
“We’ll retreat in good order to the south,
boys, if it comes to a fight. Perhaps if I
show ’em this bomb it’ll take their minds
off it for the present. Good to have it handy,
anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>All eyes were fixed on the shining bauble
as he drew it forth. The effect, however,
was somewhat different than he had intended.
A fierce cupidity shone in the eyes of the old
fellow of the trail—here was a bead that
transcended all other beads in glory!</p>

<p>“<i>Kema! Kema!</i>” (“Give! Give!”) he
grunted, avidly, holding out his hand for it.</p>

<p>The curator shook his head. “<i>Yow-yowri!</i>”
(“Bewitched!”) he said, pointing to the sun.
It flashed like a little sun in his hand, but,
far from being made afraid by its mysterious
reflections, the desire for its possession gleamed
fairly murderous out of the pygmies’ eyes.
A dozen hands reached out for it. Suddenly
a black hand like a monkey’s paw shot under
the curator’s arm and the bauble was snatched
from his hand. The whites jumped to their
feet, gathering in a close knot.</p>

<p>“This won’t do! Back off, boys, and get
a little distance from them!” barked the
curator. They drew off, Sadok’s shield and
sumpitan spear covering their immediate
retreat. But the pygmies were paying no
attention to them. They fought like wild
men for the bomb, snatching it from hand to
hand, clawing and biting at one another with
primal savagery. In the midst of the snatching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and grabbing a sharp hiss came to their
ears. They had broken off its primer in the
struggle!</p>

<p>“Run, fellows, run!” yelled the curator.
They did not stop to look back. They heard
the thing go off among the pygmies with a
thunder that shook the ground under them,
as up the hill they tore, past the tree houses
and up the stony slopes of the mountain.
Below them they could see a great sandy
crater in the center of the village, the huts
all slanting askew, while warriors were running
to the coconut trees, arming themselves
hurriedly. A short distance up the hill the
curator turned and fired the air pistol with
a long-range shell. The deafening crash of
its explosion rang through the jungle over the
village, and they saw little black men thrown
violently about, like black tumble-bugs, with
its concussion. They waited no longer, but
toiled up the hill as fast as they could climb.
Shouts below and calls in the jungle came to
their ears. There was plenty of fight left
in the little hill men, and they knew that the
mountain was being surrounded and that a
jungle fight of the most difficult character
lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>For a time they climbed steadily. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
vegetation was thin and one could see for
some distance, so that the native archers
could not get up close as in the deep jungle.
With Sadok and Baderoon as outliers, they
headed for the top. The mountain was
another extinct volcanic cone, and the same
outcroppings of lava rock, the same belts of
century plants and aloes, were met as on the
mountain back of Cassowary Camp.</p>

<p>Next came bare patches of huge volcanic
rocks. They could look out, here, over the
sea of jungle-covered mountains, and from
the curve of the sides of their own they judged
that it was a perfect cone, a volcano of somewhat
recent activity. Sadok came running
in, and in his hand was a long cane arrow.
The point was blood-red, and at first they
thought he had been hit, but his actions did
not indicate it.</p>

<p>“Littly black man close!” he breathed,
heavily. “Shoot’m arrow.”</p>

<p>The curator took the missile and examined
its head carefully. It was made of a blood-red,
six-sided crystal, thinned to a point and
lustrous and polished.</p>

<p>“Cinnabar, boys!” he exclaimed. “This
tribe know all about Red Mountain. That’s
why they wouldn’t let us go south, and it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
why the southern tribe at Wamberibi would
not let the English go north, too! I bet we
see it when we reach this cone top!”</p>

<p>They pressed on swiftly, the vegetation
now scattered and consisting only of the most
arid and gnarly species, all plentifully provided
with thorns.</p>

<p>“Look, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!” called Baderoon,
hastily, pointing back down the mountain.</p>

<p>Five small hill men were climbing after
them on the slopes.</p>

<p>“Never mind them. Put out for the top,
boys,” shouted the curator, running after
them. “We’ve got to get there and dig in
before any flanking parties cut us off.”</p>

<p>They raced up over the lava-strewn slopes.
The top of the mountain was a bare cone,
with a deep, narrow crater, perhaps fifty feet
in bore, extending down into it. A faint odor
of sulphur came up from its dark depths.
Around the lip was fine lava dust and small
rocks. For at least fifty yards down the
slopes there was no cover of any sort.</p>

<p>“You and Sadok stand off those beggars,
Dwight. Dig in on the rim of the crater and
pick ’em off. Here’s where we make our
stand for the present,” ordered the curator,
as he and the rest of the party ran around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the crater to the south. They pawed shallow
pits in the detritus and lay down, watching
the slopes below. No pygmies had come
in sight yet, but there was much that was
interesting to study. Out of the jungle
clearing on the opposite mountain, beyond
them to the south, rose the smoke of a huge
signal fire, and their glasses could make out
huts in the trees near it. To the east, the
long wall of the Great Precipice stretched
southward, halving one side of the mountain
ranges, with the green of the lowland jungle
swarming up to its base. Near its brink was
a small clearing and yet another pygmy
village. It was their country, all right!</p>

<p>But to the southeast rose a sight that
held them all breathless. The geological
formation in the interior was dark and
stratified, of basic instead of volcanic rock,
and the ragged edges of thin coal seams
could be picked out running through the
jungle along bare escarpments. Before them
rose sheer a truncated cone of a mountain,
separated from the interior formations by
a deep gap. Its whole upper half was bare
of jungle, and across it, in a horizontal belt,
ran a vein of deep pink, at least four hundred
feet from top to bottom!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Red Mountain!” gasped the curator, as
he and Nicky stared speechless at the fabulous
wealth spread out before their eyes.
“Pure cinnabar—and Lord knows how many
million tons of it! It makes that Mexican
deposit look like a thirty-cent Mex. dollar
when you want to buy a tin of white man’s
tobacco with it! Well, while we’ve got time,
the most important thing in the world to
do now is to locate that mountain on the
map.”</p>

<p>The crack of Dwight’s automatic came to
their ears as the curator got out his notebook
and the mess kit with his surveyor’s compass
packed in one of its pans. Dwight and
Sadok were already at work, they could hear,
and as they opened out the map page a long
cane arrow came singing over their shoulders
and soared on down the slope.</p>

<p>“Gee! They must be getting close up on
that side! Make it snappy, sir!” said Nicky,
drawing his revolver and laying it on a rock
beside him.</p>

<p>“We’ll add about three miles to the base
line, from the banyan tree to this cone,” said
the curator, imperturbably, drawing it in
with his pencil. Then he sighted Red Mountain
most carefully through the compass bars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
“Distance, about seven miles in an air line,
I should judge. What do you think, Nick?”</p>

<p>Baderoon, to their right, gave a grunt and
shot his stout bow. The arrow soared down
the slope and into a thick aloe clump on the
edge of the jungle. A little black man rose
out of it and fell over backward.</p>

<p>“Good shot, Baderoon!” commented Nicky,
admiringly. There was no better archer, or
fighter, either, than their Papuan “black boy!”
Nicky squinted across at Red Mountain,
shimmering in the distance.</p>

<p>“Seven, or nearly eight miles, I should
say,” he pronounced, judgmatically.</p>

<p>An arrow sprung from a rock about seventy
yards down the slope as he spoke. It came
nosing up to them and fell just in front.</p>

<p>Nicky sighted the spot with his Officer’s
Model. “Here’s where I scintillate!” he
laughed. “This old six-gun’s at her best at
long range. Save your shells, Mr. Baldwin.
I’ll get that bird!”</p>

<p>Another arrow soared overhead, coming
from the west. Then the curator gave a
low exclamation.</p>

<p>“Look, Nick! There goes another signal
fire, far to the south. We’ll have all pygmy
land around us in another day!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>The revolver barked at that instant, and
a puff of dust flew out from the side of the
rock behind which a hill man lay concealed.</p>

<p>“Scared him to death, anyhow!” joked
Nicky, turning to look at the new fire.</p>

<p>“We’re surrounded, all right, except on
the east, and we can’t hold off a whole army
of them,” said the curator. “We’ve got two
impossible things to do, as I see it—get in to
Red Mountain and bring off some specimens
and then make our escape from the country.”</p>

<p>“Fat chance!” grunted Nicky, cheerfully,
firing his revolver again.</p>

<p>The curator studied the prospect to the
east, for there lay their only hope of escape.
The terrific geological fault that had made the
Great Precipice was nearly buried on that
side by the outpourings from their volcano
when it had been active, but the lava swept
down to the precipice edge in a frightful
slope, where it ended abruptly. Blue distance
beyond it told of a considerable drop;
how much could not be conjectured.</p>

<p>The arrows were coming more thickly,
now. It seemed that at least twenty of the
little hill men lay concealed in among the
bowlders below them, and the occasional
pop of Dwight’s automatic told that more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of them had come up on his side also. Only
to the east was there a free passage, but no
man could live on that slope. Nicky and
Baderoon were both busy, and once in a
while they would get one of the pygmies,
exposing himself recklessly in some crawl to
a nearer point of vantage. The curator
borrowed Nicky’s alcohol cook kit and went
down below the rim of the crater to a little
rocky ledge inside on the brink of its deep
bore. Here he set about making a mulligan
for the party, for it was now long past high
noon. He shook his half-empty canteen after
filling the soup tin.</p>

<p>“Water running low!” he muttered,
uneasily. “We’ve got to get out of this
to-night! It’s up to me to do a scout down
to the precipice brink this afternoon, sometime.”</p>

<p>A perfect fusillade of shots, and a yell for
help from Dwight’s side, caused him to jump
to his feet hastily and rush for that side of
the crater. Putting his head cautiously over
the brink, he instantly whipped out his air
gun, for a long black line of pygmies was
charging up the slope, each man behind his
shield, the yellow blades of their bamboo
knives sticking up over their shoulders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Sadok’s sumpitan was powerless against them,
and Dwight was frantically shoving a fresh
clip into the butt of his automatic. Then
a shell from the air gun whistled on its way,
and its explosion burst in a riving crash over
the center of the black line. Dwight opened
fire and those on the right flank began to fall
back, while Sadok, no longer able to contain
himself, dashed down the slope at the survivors
of the left flank. He flung himself at
them with whirling parang as bamboo knives
flashed out, and in another instant he was
in the center of a whirlwind of flashing knives.
The parang-ihlang sheared through their
shields like paper, for Sadok was a star
swordsman. Five to one, he was getting the
best of them, when the white flash of a keen
bamboo knife cut him across the shoulder
and he fell, guarding himself with the parang
in his left hand.</p>

<p>Dwight’s bullets flew like hail, while the
curator dashed down the slope, armed only
with Sadok’s abandoned sumpitan spear. In
a second he found himself facing the shields
of the two pygmy survivors, who circled him
with ready knives. They were as light as
feathers, but so keen that a single cut would
sever off a head, the curator knew; also that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
he was a mere dub with that spear! Standing
over Sadok, he stood them off with the spear
point, while the little black men danced and
feinted around him, watching their chance.
He had counted on Dwight following him,
but a quick patter of shots from the crater
came to his ears, telling that they were busy
at something urgent up there, too. Then
Sadok staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>“Shoot, <i>Orang</i>!” he gasped, hoarsely. In
a flash the curator divined his meaning. The
sumpitan held a dart! He raised it suddenly
to his lips and blew the missile full into the
face of the pygmy opposite him. The other
dashed in, to be met by the flash of Sadok’s
parang, which sheared the bamboo knife
aimed at the curator like a straw. Defenseless,
he turned and ran for the jungle, while
the other pygmy fell in a limp heap before
him.</p>

<p>With Sadok leaning heavily on him, weak
from loss of blood, the curator crawled slowly
up the slope. Another arrow came singing
out of the jungle and sailed close over their
heads. With a curse of rage, he turned and
shelled the spot with his air gun. A crackle
of fire followed the detonation. The dry
thicket seemed to leap into red flame, set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
afire by the shell, and clouds of white smoke
swept up the slope after them. Meanwhile
a heavy sputtering of pistol shots came from
over the crater brim. Acting on a sudden
impulse, the curator bore off to the east and
dropped Sadok behind some bowlders near
the rim of the precipice. Then he crawled
down carefully from rock to rock, looking up
anxiously over his shoulder at the summit,
for they were evidently hard pressed up
there. The yawning abyss fell away below
him as he came to the edge and looked over.
Below was the green jungle of no-man’s
land, the vegetation creeping up the lava
talus part way, where it was finally stopped
by lack of moisture and soil. From the brink
to the nearest point below was at least a
hundred feet of sheer fall, and from there on
down the slope was the limit angle of repose.
Without a long rope there was no escape
that way.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the curator to himself, after
an examination, “of the two impossibilities,
we’ll have to give up Red Mountain and try
this! Eight miles through pygmy land, with
them buzzing like hornets about us—good
Lord!” he groaned. “Our report will have
to go as it stands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>A yell came from Dwight, up in the crater.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Mr. Baldwin?” it called.
“We stood ’em off! Close call! Hurry up!
they’re getting ready for another rush.”</p>

<p>“Bring everything and come on down
here!” he yelled back. “Now’s your chance.”</p>

<p>Presently Dwight, Nicky, and Baderoon
came creeping over the brink on the north
side. They slid down the slope on their
backs and flung themselves among the first
large bowlders. The jungle to the north
was now a crackling mass of fire, driven on
by the west monsoon, while a fog of smoke
covered that side. Behind it lay the pygmies,
unable to pass, and they were safe for the
present from that quarter. But how soon
a rush would be made from the west and
south they could not tell. The curator
crept back and brought Sadok from where
he lay hidden in the bowlders. Bandaging
the gash on his right shoulder as swiftly as
he could, he got their party together on the
precipice brink and each man contributed
whatever he had that would go toward making
a rope. The boys’ two tent ropes, the
curator’s hammock rope, and Sadok’s turban
cloth were knotted together hastily. Then
came the curator’s hammock and the two tent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
flies. Tying the upper end to a gnarly ironwood
bush that grew near the brink, they
let it all down over the cliff, where the lower
end dangled far below, still some twenty feet
above the slope.</p>

<p>“Won’t do!” said the curator, grimly,
hauling it up again. “A man’s got to land
there on his feet or he’ll never escape pitching
on down that steep slope. Quick, now, all
your belts, boys!” They were added on
and the rope lowered again. Shouts and
yells came from the summit. At least forty
of the little men were up there, singing and
dancing with victory around the crater.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off!” said Nicky, who was the
most fearless climber of them all. He shook
hands abruptly and swung over the brink.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br>

<small>CINNABAR MOUNTAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A CHORUS of shouts arose from the
pygmies as they discovered the little
knot of whites clustered on the precipice
brink. Brandishing their weapons, they
climbed on down, shooting as they ran. The
curator stopped them with a shell that shook
the mountain side like an earthquake and
sent a shower of stones rolling down upon
their own position. A yell came up from
below. Nicky had arrived on the slope and
was stamping a shelf in the lava stones, sending
showers of them rolling on down below
him. Dwight grabbed the rope and went
down after him, leaving his automatic with
the curator. The hill men were now sneaking
down toward them, exposing themselves
only occasionally to the sumpitan and pistol.</p>

<p>“Good-by, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!” said Baderoon,
fumbling next at the rope. “Me prenty
’fraid—but me go!” He swung himself over
and dropped down swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“You next, Sadok. Can you manage it?”
said the curator, anxiously. The Dyak smiled
grimly; wounds, weakness, physical disability,
were nothing when the spirit commanded.
His fearless face showed that his
mind could overrule the frailties of his
body.</p>

<p>“Me do!” he grunted, and down over the
cliff he went, his wounded right arm forced
to do its part. The curator turned and
faced the pygmies.</p>

<p>“Fine little men!” he grinned. “Some
day you will be swept away like chaff—but
here’s one explorer who can appreciate you!
Good-by!”</p>

<p>He swung over and dropped down the rope,
hand over hand. The men of that old, old
race, centuries before the first Papuan came
to these shores, were still in his mind as he
descended. He regretted that he could not
have lived with them peacefully and studied
their natures more thoroughly. The ancient
civilization of the hunting tribes was theirs,
and with it a mental quality that had kept
them inviolate among their hills in spite of
a ring of hostile Papuan savages below them,
far superior in stature and numbers to all
their tribes put together. Like most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
real aborigines of the world, they would well
repay study.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the foot of the rope
the rest of the party had tramped quite a
trail along the foot of the cliff. Stones that
now showered over from above told them that
it was essential to get to the jungle as quickly
as possible, and the shortest way was obviously
along the cliff base and over the turn of the
volcanic cone poured down here by former
eruptions.</p>

<p>But Nicky looked back at the rope, longingly.
He hated to leave all that good
equipment behind. The rope part they could
dispense with, but without the curator’s hammock
and their own tent flies the jungle
would be a misery during the afternoon
thunderstorms.</p>

<p>“Hike along, boys. I’m going to make
a try at that rope before they find it and haul
it up!”</p>

<p>Unmindful of the curator’s expostulations,
amid the rain of falling stones, he crouched
close to the cliff face and drew out his revolver.
Most of the stones were dropping far out;
it would be a mere chance if he were hit.
Three times he fired at the knot above the
curator’s hammock, a mark perhaps forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
feet off. Then an arrow struck the rock at
his feet with a sharp tang, and, looking up,
he saw one of the pygmies leaning far out
over the cliff, aiming at him again. The
rope had shaken a little at one of the shots
and on this faint hope he sprang for the tent
fly and tugged fiercely at it. He thought he
felt a strand or two of it break and so jumped
up on the tent fly, coming down with all his
weight. Another arrow spun past him. He
realized that it was only the peculiarity of
having a vertical target that saved him, for
the archer above was overshooting him because
of it. With a last violent tug the rope strand
parted, and Nicky sprawled headlong down
the lava slope. Like a cat he spread-eagled,
flattening himself out on the rubble of small
stones, and finally he fetched up a considerable
distance down the slope.</p>

<p>He was now a mark for a dozen arrows
from above and they buzzed at him like hornets.
Rising, he leaped on down, stabbing
with his feet and sending an avalanche of
rocks on before him. His strides kept getting
longer and longer. A breathless feeling of
getting out of control, falling down the slope
faster and faster, made him think quick.
He must stop himself at any hazard, risk a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
fall, if need be! He resolved on the latter,
and, throwing himself sidewise, came down
with a bump that jarred every bone in his
body. He saw stars for an instant, but held
his consciousness. Looking back, he could
see that he was far out of range now. Rubbing
himself painfully, he got up and started
to step gingerly from rock to rock across
the slope.</p>

<p>But the hill men weren’t done with him
yet. A great stone fell over the cliff and
came bounding down straight toward him.
Nicky dodged it, as derisive yells came from
up above. Two more rocks came whizzing
down the slope, bounding like cannon balls.
They seemed very terrific, but the boy stood
his ground and watched them pass, shooting
in a great arc high overhead and landing
with a shock against the trees down in the
jungle below. He realized that he was not
so easy to hit; that all it required was watchfulness
and care to win out.</p>

<p>The slope was so steep that he could toss
a pebble clear down to the jungle below him,
it seemed. Rocks, cactus, and century plants
covered the hill, the former so unstable
that they had to be tested before putting
weight on them. As quickly as he could the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
boy picked his way along the slope, dodging
rocks of all sizes flung down from above.
Shouts of encouragement came from his
own party under the cliff, who now were
moving along fast, calling for him to hurry.
Then a yell of warning echoed down from
the curator, and Nicky looked up, bewildered.
The hill men had brought a pole from the
jungle and were prying off a whole ledge of
stones hanging loosely poised above the
cliff edge.</p>

<p>He leaped along like a mountain goat,
stumbling and sliding, starting rocks by the
dozen. The pygmies had chosen a place
where the avalanche would fall right across
his path, and he could hear the distant grumble
of it as he jumped. Desperately his eyes
looked below for a refuge, and then he dove
for a huge bowlder and fell flat behind it as
the roar, it seemed, of the whole slope coming
down upon him sounded in his ears. Determined
to die game, he rose behind his rock
as the noise swept down toward him, for he
was more afraid that his own rock would
start and crush him than anything else, and
had determined to leap out at the first sign
of its going.</p>

<p>Then came the roar of hurtling stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
passing over him in a flying cloud of dust.
The thunder of it was appalling. His own
rock moved with the jar, slightly, and then
settled back on its foundations again as
Nicky recalled the impulse to jump clear.
Then came a wave of fine pebbles and dust,
curling around the ends of his rock and forming
a sort of pit around him. Showers of
small stones cascaded over the top and fell
down on him like a rain. It gave him an
idea. As the landslide subsided he crouched,
hidden behind the rock. Anxious calls came
from under the cliff, but Nicky lay hid. Why
not pretend that the avalanche had buried
him? He only hoped that the curator or
Dwight would not attempt to come out and
rescue him.</p>

<p>The silence up on the cliff was broken by
exulting yells, and he could hear them stringing
along now above the precipice, searching
for the whereabouts of the curator’s party below.
If they would only keep on without him!</p>

<p>Another “<i>Coo-eee!</i>” came from under the
cliff. “<i>Nicky! Are you alive, old scout?</i>”
came the yell of Dwight’s voice.</p>

<p>He dared not call back. The hill men were
too keen, and not easily fooled. He lay
quiet, listening. Presently the crackle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
falling stones and more yells and cries along
the cliff told that their party had been located.
They were probably retreating along under
the cliff as fast as possible. Nicky turned
and crept down the slope on his stomach,
looking back to see that the rock still hid him
from sight of the cliff top above. Then he
worked over behind a small bush and peered
up through it. Whether there were hill men
watching the slope, concealed among the
rocks above, he could not tell, but there probably
were. The whole north side of the
volcano was smoking with the jungle fire and
it crept down until the thickets on the verge
of the precipice were red with burning trees.
He noted with relief that it barred the passage
of their pursuers that way, or at least it
necessitated a detour, and he hoped that their
party had gotten away.</p>

<p>Whether to risk exposing himself now was
the question. He was alone in the heart of
wildest New Guinea, and it was necessary
to rejoin their party and make a speed back
toward the boat, for undoubtedly the hill
men knew of a defile down the precipice
somewhere which would let them out into
no-man’s land. Also thunderheads were
sweeping up from the south, and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
not be an hour before the afternoon storm
would be due.</p>

<p>Well, one thing was certain, he ought to
let his people know that he was still alive
before they got out of hearing. Nicky drew
his revolver and fired two shots quick with
it. A whoop came from up on the mountain.
They were watching the slope still! Then
two shots from Dwight’s automatic barked,
muffled, from over the shoulder of the cone.
It sounded as if from the jungle. They would
either wait for him there or circle, the boy
reasoned. Probably the latter, and he could
rejoin them down below at the foot of the
slope. And now was the time to run, for he
could hear the hill men above calling for
their companions and presently the whole
tribe would be back.</p>

<p>Nicky rose and jumped down the slope.
He got a glimpse over his shoulder of two
tiny black fellows dancing and hurling rocks
impotently, and then gave all his attention to
getting down, for the slide was steeper than
a log chute. Swiftly the jungle seemed to
rise up to meet him, and with a final bound
he reached the friendly shelter of the trees
and darted out of sight.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, his aching, bruised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
leg forced itself into consciousness and he
began to limp. Directing shots between
him and Dwight gave them his location, and
then calls and shouts brought them together.</p>

<p>Dwight came running through the jungle,
grinning with joy.</p>

<p>“Gee! old man, we’d given you up for
lost!” he yelled, capering about and punching
Nicky with delight. “Got all the plunder
with you, too, haven’t you!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” gurgled Nicky, happily. “That’s
what this war’s all about! Where’s Mr.
Baldwin?”</p>

<p>“Back there a bit, waiting for us,” said
Dwight. “We got to make time. Forced
march all night.”</p>

<p>“Going to be a wet one, too!” retorted
Nicky, limping along as a mutter of thunder
came rolling up from the south. “We’d
better keep the tent flies out.”</p>

<p>They rejoined the curator, who noticed
the game leg as soon as Nicky came up.
“Tough luck, kid!” he said, after congratulations
had been exchanged. “I’ll have to
ask you to grin and bear it as best you can,
for we’ve got our work cut out for us to-night!”
He drew his compass, took a bearing—and
started <i>south</i>, through the jungle!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>A general grunt of amazement ran through
the party. “Why, Mr. Baldwin, I thought
we were to hurry north, so as to get back to
the canoe ahead of them!” cried Dwight,
voicing the feeling of them all.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” replied the curator,
heading on steadily through the thickets just
below the base of the volcanic talus. “It’s
a bit of psychology that I’ve been working
out. In the first place the pygmies, I’m
sure, think as you all thought. They judged
by our actions that we were beaten and would
think of nothing but hurrying back to the
sea again. They will make forced marches,
to-night, to head us off, I’ll bet! And then
we must reckon on the human nature of our
own folks, too. ‘Seeing is believing’ is one
of the truest old sayings there are. In other
words, we’ve simply <i>got</i> to bring back some
real specimens of that cinnabar and be able
to swear where we got it. No financier that
I know will back a company to open up mines
on the mere say-so of a red mountain seen
eight miles off. I know red mercury ore
strata as far as I can see it—but I <i>might</i> be
mistaken. Suppose it should turn out to
be just red clay, or red iron ore!”</p>

<p>“Gosh, sir! you’re right!” put in Nicky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
“I sort of felt that way myself, but I suppose
I did not feel it hard enough to really do a
stunt like this!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” smiled the curator. “It’s the
difference between a youth and a man,
Nick. The youth gets the vague feeling, but
he’s as like as not to do nothing about it;
the man reasons until he is convinced by the
force of logic—then he acts. Now I was
studying the wall of the Great Precipice
when we were on the brink doing the rope
fire-escape trick, with just this idea in mind.
There are gaps in this precipice all along it,
where the rivers tumble down from the hill
country to the low jungle on their way to
the sea. I marked one, some distance beyond
that first signal fire to the south. It can’t
be more than five miles from there in to
Cinnabar Mountain, and the gap’s about
five miles from here. Can we do ten miles
to-night? That’s the question.”</p>

<p>“How about getting past that village?”
asked Dwight.</p>

<p>“That’s the nice thing about my scheme,”
laughed the curator. “I figure that all their
fighting men have gone north, long ago, to
aid the men of our village in repelling invaders.
Those signal fires are evidently used to call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the clans when war parties of the Outanatas
attack them. The women and children, and
perhaps a few old men, will be all that we
are likely to encounter, and we ought to slip
by them successfully in the night.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they come down our rope and
track us, sir?” said Nicky. “I’ve been worrying
about that, although no one tried it
while I was on that slope.”</p>

<p>“You answered that with your revolver,
Nick!” chuckled the curator. “No man
can drop forty feet to that talus and live.
Of course they may bring up more ropes, in
time, but my idea is that all that’s left of
them, with perhaps a party of fighting men
from this village ahead, are now hot-footing
it for some pass that they know of to the
north. We’ll be on Red Mountain and
giving them the laugh while they are looking
for us up near the lagoon—and let’s hope
they fall in with a war party of the Outanatas
while they are about it! Here comes the
rain, men,” he broke off. “We’ll make
camp and cook something and get a bit of
sleep until the moon comes up.”</p>

<p>They chose a spot well hidden in the jungle
and the tent flies were spread on poles. A
monumental feed was cooked, between Nicky’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
alcohol burner and a small fire well hidden
in the rocks under the tents, while the rain
came down in its usual torrential downpour.
Then they all turned in for some much-needed
sleep. By nine o’clock the rain had stopped
and a faint light over the jungle promised
moonlight through the thinning clouds. The
party was roused out and they broke camp,
Nicky and Sadok, who were stiff and sore,
being rubbed down with arnica by the
curator before setting out. With the tent
flies wrapped around them, the three whites
set out through the wet jungle, with Sadok
and Baderoon, whose naked skins seemed
to revel in the raindrops, leading on
ahead.</p>

<p>In an hour they had reached the banks of
a small, swift stream, the headwaters of
some river that emptied into the sea fifty
miles away. Alligators, water snakes, and
giant frogs plopped into its eddying depths
as they came up. The splash and gurgle of
waterfalls came from up the slope. Pushing
along carefully, on the lookout for pythons
and snakes of lesser degree, they climbed up
along its banks. Steeper and more rocky
became the gorge through which it defiled.
Then rocky ledges of black basalt hemmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
them in on both sides, and out of the gap
cascaded a foaming waterfall.</p>

<p>In the weird moonlight, with the black
shadows almost solid to the touch, it seemed
to Nicky and Dwight that that was the most
perilous climb they had ever ventured upon.
Baderoon was quaking with fear and hanging
back reluctantly, for he was no hill man, but
the curator and the intrepid Sadok led on
upward, pioneering out the way and hauling
them up the steeper ledges by a tent fly let
down for a rope. Higher and higher they
climbed, the jungle falling away below almost
vertically, while towering above them rose
the walls of the gorge for thousands of feet.
It seemed good to be at last buried deep in
the cleft, with visions of the awful fate that
would befall them below, if any slipped, hid
mercifully from sight.</p>

<p>The stream came down in a series of cascades,
varied by steep stretches where it
sluiced along through deep channels in the
rock. At one place they came to a veritable
waterwheel where the whole torrent raced
down a slope into a shallow basin scooped
out of the solid basalt, and it shot up in a
roaring pinwheel of water through which
not even Sadok’s sumpitan could be driven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Above it the walls of the gorge closed in
to a narrow cleft, with high, vertical sides.
There was no getting past, on either side!</p>

<p>“Case of swim!” ejaculated the curator,
as they all stopped and looked in at the deep
pool filling the cleft from wall to wall like a
black ribbon. “Get out your flashers, boys.
There’s one grain of comfort in it, anyway—no
one would ever dream that we’d come up
this way!”</p>

<p>They undressed and did up the bundles
in the tent flies.</p>

<p>“Glory be to Mike, there are no anacondas
in New Guinea!” shivered Nicky, looking
at the black pool and thinking of former
Guiana jungle days.</p>

<p>Still, it took courage to negotiate that
pool! They scanned every inch of the wall
for snakes and then plunged in, close together
for mutual protection, the flashlights tied
atop the boys’ heads with their bandannas,
and the packs strapped on their shoulders.
It seemed that that pool would never end!
Its narrow ribbon of still water wound on
and on through the cleft, with here and there
a ledge or a rock shelf over which the water
tumbled in a silent spillway, and where they
could get out and rest. From ahead came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
louder and louder, the roar of a waterfall.
The curator listened uneasily. Such a cascade
would be a catastrophe, for, if there
was no way around it, by no possibility
could they get up farther.</p>

<p>They hurried on eagerly, now, anxious to
learn their fate, fear of some unknown thing
seizing them from under water forgotten.
A final pool showed up in the glare of the
flashlights. The curator heaved a huge sigh
of relief, for the head of the pool was a foaming
suds of eddying water into which the
stream of the cascade tumbled from above,
and—blessed sight!—sticking up out of it
was a huge tree, jammed in there by some
freshet, its upper end jutting out into the
stars which shone through the opening of
the cleft!</p>

<p>“Praise be!” ejaculated the curator, plunging
in. “Come here, tree—I love you!”</p>

<p>They all swam over, and one by one crept
up the log. A low hail from the curator, and
the hissed caution, “Lights out!” told them
that he had arrived safely in the ravine above.
They found him already dressing. They
were in a steep, rocky ravine, filled with
jungle growth, and out of the bare rocks at
last. Hastily the boys dressed and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
up their packs again. Sadok and Baderoon
had merely to shake themselves and they
were ready for further adventures.</p>

<p>“All aboard—and no talking!” whispered
the curator, as they pushed on up the ravine.
For a mile it climbed steeply, and then Sadok
halted and pointed silently into the jungle.
A well-defined path came down to the brook
here; and there were empty gourds and
crude pottery jars on the bank.</p>

<p>“We are opposite the second village,”
whispered the curator. “Step lightly, fellows,
and be careful not to break a stick.
We’ll bear off to the left, to high ground.”</p>

<p>They went on noiselessly, following the
general windings of the creek in the bright
moonlight. After another mile of it the
curator halted.</p>

<p>“I’ve a hunch that Red Mountain is
somewhere near us by now,” he muttered,
cautiously. “Nicky, you’re the best climber.
Swarm up that pandanus, as high as you can
get, and take a look-see.”</p>

<p>Nicky went over to the tree and was soon
up in its branches. Below him fell away
the lesser growth of the jungle. Other tall
trees still surrounded him, but as he shinnied
up a high branch, at last a vista to the east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
opened up. For a long time he gazed, with
all the exultation of the civilized white man,
on an object of immense value to his race,
even though surrounded and protected by
a ring of savagery. Before him, shimmering
in the clear moonlight, lay the irregular
truncated cone of Red Mountain, the enormous
vein of cinnabar parting its upper half
like pink layer cake! Black seams of coal
measures streaking the mountain face told
of the geological period when the mountain
was born. Behind it piled up the stratified
peaks and table-lands of similar mountain
formations. The whole story lay clear in
the educated, scientific mind of the boy, and
he thrilled with its significance. Here lay
the true geological formation of the interior
of Dutch New Guinea, with Red Mountain
as a last outpost. Behind him lay the tremendous
fault of the Great Precipice, with
its chain of volcanoes resulting from that
mighty crack in the earth’s surface. But
before him lay all the mineral wealth of New
Guinea—coal measures, iron ore, what not—that
would make this vast island, the largest
in the world—almost a continent—a land
of the utmost value to the white race!</p>

<p>Coming back to earth from these explorer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
dreams, Nicky got out his compass and took
the mountain bearing. It was not over two
miles from where they were to the slopes of
Red Mountain. Between them lay a low,
jungle-clad ridge; beyond it a swale or hollow
of some kind, and then the slopes themselves.
He swarmed down the tree to report,
and then they all set out eagerly, in a straight
line through the dry, arid thickets.</p>

<p>In half an hour they reached the top of the
little ridge, and the curator found a leaning
dead tree and climbed out on it for a long,
soul-satisfying look for himself. Returning,
they pitched down into the swale, crossed it,
and began to climb. Their watches said
four o’clock in the morning, so it was necessary
to hasten, as they would be in plain sight on
that bald spot.</p>

<p>Up and up the steep hillside they struggled,
bidding the jungle good-by, negotiating shelves
and rocky escarpments that turned out to
be ledges ten feet high when they came to
them. Far overhead towered the flat side
of the mountain, almost a precipice, and the
depths dropping below warned them that it
would be mountaineering of the most dangerous
kind.</p>

<p>A few more ledges; soul-harrowing crawls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
up rocky faces to which they clung with feet
digging into tiny crevices and fingers clawing
desperately at crumbly holds, and they had
reached the bottom edge of the vein!</p>

<p>Dwight’s pick dug into the rich, red ore,
and a lump of translucent scarlet crystals,
hard as adamant and surrounded with a
matrix of crumbling red ore, fell out into his
hand. He passed it to the curator.</p>

<p>“We’ve sure gone through hell for it, sir!”
he exclaimed. “I guess we’ve done our bit
for New Guinea, eh?”</p>

<p>“We sure have!” exclaimed the curator,
feelingly. “You and Nicky each get a specimen
like this and stow it in your packs. And
now, fellows, an air line for our camp on the
lagoon. We can make it in two days!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI<br>

<small>THE FLIGHT TO THE COAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAWN was paling in the east as they crept
slowly down the ledges of Red Mountain.
The going down was far worse than
the climb up, and the tent flies had to be
called in play again to get over vertical drops
of ten feet or more where one’s eyes could
not see below how to climb down. Even
then the haunting fear that some old pygmy
watcher from the village might have spied
them on the mountain side lent haste to their
descent. It was with relief that they all
gathered in the depths of the jungle again.</p>

<p>“Now, then, fellows, there’s only one way
we can do this march to the coast. We
three will have to keep together while Sadok
scouts on ahead. Baderoon I’m going to
turn loose, and let him run for it for Cassowary
Camp and then down that trail to the
Outanata village, where he can get a war
party started back to rescue us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Baderoon, you-fellah run catch’m Outanata
man?” he asked.</p>

<p>The negro grinned. He looked fresh and
fit, and his long legs could take him like a
moose through the jungle.</p>

<p>“<i>Orang-kaya</i> give me-fellah sign take ’long
black boy?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Sure! They might murder you for your
mirror, in all your youth and innocence!”
laughed the curator. “Here, Nicky, get out
a couple of your empty alcohol tins. The
chief’d love them, to put in his ears.”</p>

<p>Baderoon eyed them longingly as Nicky
got out the cans from his rucksack. He’d
have dearly loved to put them in his own
ears, only the important detail of stretching
the lobe enough for such ornaments had been
neglected in his youth. Such does contact
with civilized whites debase the poor savage!
He handled the cans reverently, and finally
stowed them somehow in his loin cloth.</p>

<p>“Tell’m the Thunderer make war on litty
black men—plenty heads!” grinned the curator.
“Run—plenty—too much!”</p>

<p>Baderoon laughed merrily and set off into
the jungle without a word. By some way
known only to himself he would cover those
thirty miles that day, threading alone through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the trackless jungle. By noon next day a
war party of the Outanatas would be halfway
back to them, thirsting for a foray on their
ancient enemies, the pygmies—with the powerful
aid of the man who called down the
lightnings—or the curator was no judge of
human nature!</p>

<p>After Baderoon had gone, they studied the
mountains and valleys to the south for some
time, planning a route.</p>

<p>“That big sugar loaf to the northeast looks
familiar to me, Nick,” said the curator.
“Don’t you remember it, from our banyan
tree outlook?”</p>

<p>They got out the map, and presently
located it from bearings taken on the map
from their position on Red Mountain. Once
on that sugar loaf, it would be easy to locate
the bald knob above Cassowary Camp.</p>

<p>He pointed out the shoulder to Sadok.
“We go there,” he explained. “You stop
’long front. You see black man, make’m
call like red lory, two time, and come back.”</p>

<p>Sadok comprehended quickly, and with a
white flash of his teeth led on, his sumpitan
balanced in his hands for instant use, and so
they set out. In two hours they had reached
the shoulder, some six miles through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
jungle, and were cautiously reconnoitering
for a lookout. After some climbing, a ledge
was found that rose over the summits of the
trees below. They wormed up it and lay
flat in the grass on its edge, spying out the
country with their glasses. Over to the east
rose the cone of the old volcano, with the
pygmy village on it, the girls’ tree huts
visible like white specks in the sunlit clearing.
Beyond that was the mountain with the great
banyan tree on its north shoulder, and
beyond that again in the blue distance, about
twelve miles off, the bald knob above Cassowary
Camp.</p>

<p>But it was the green jungle below them
that they searched most carefully. The view
below was not reassuring. The haze of at
least three fires rose above the trees at widely
different points. Allowing forty men to each
war party, there would be over a hundred
of the pygmy warriors outlying between
them and their home base.</p>

<p>“We’ll stay right here, boys, until the rain—and
then, by George! we’ll try to push
through them during the storm!” declared
the curator, with sudden resolution. “It’ll
be pitch black for at least two hours after
that. How’s the ammunition, fellows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“I’ve only got twelve cartridges left, sir,”
said Nicky, lugubriously, “and Dwight has
two clips, and then he’s through.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve only got four shells, myself,”
said the curator, cheerfully. “Two of them
are thirty-yard close-ups. We’ll have to husband
ammunition for a possible rush, and
depend on Sadok. You got’m plenty dart,
Sadok?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Dyak shook his head and opened the
cover of his bamboo quiver. “Poison him
all gone, too!” he announced.</p>

<p>“We’ve got our work cut out for us, then!
We’ll camp and get something to eat, and
then wait until the clouds come before setting
out. Meanwhile we’ll have to find a
upas vine, or something like it. Either
of you boys know strychnine when you
see it?”</p>

<p>They shook their heads. Botany was out
of their line.</p>

<p>“Got to know ’most everything if you’re
a scientist,” grinned the curator, deprecatingly.
“Well, the species we want is <i>S. tieute</i>,
native of all this archipelago, the upas vine.
It’s a climbing shrub, five-leaved, with little
bunches of berries in a leathery rind like a
small dried orange.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“I think I’ve noticed one or two like that,
sir, myself, going through the jungle,” said
Dwight, reminiscently. “Climbs all over
larger trees, doesn’t it?” He sketched a leaf
on a bit of rock as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Yep. That’s him. You and Sadok scout
around for one while Nick and I get ready
some eats,” said the curator. “You may
also find the upas <i>tree</i>, which is of the bread-fruit
family, but I doubt it. Never heard
of it south of Java. Look for a tall tree a
hundred feet high, with lanceolate leaves and
berries in a drooping cluster. Both are used
for poisoning arrows and darts, from the
Philippines south.”</p>

<p>Dwight arranged a lory call for Sadok, in
case either of them should need the other,
and they separated, each vanishing into the
lower jungle.</p>

<p>Dwight walked along, searching the jungle
growth with keen eyes. Gradually his course
led him around the flank to the south and
into a deep ravine, with great trees dropping
down the slopes below him into the depths.
It was impossible to see far, in here, so he
climbed up a small tree and looked out.
The ravine led up the mountain side, with
all the jungle spread out like a map on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
flanks. Searching carefully each giant trunk,
he at length spied one overgrown with a
profusion of some vine that looked promising,
and, marking it, he set out. In ten minutes
he was close enough to the vine to examine
it more carefully. The reddish bark, the
five-fingered leaf, looked as if it might be one
of that famous family of strychnine trees that
extends all around the tropics, from India
through the archipelago, to South America
and across Africa. Dwight thrilled with a
primal, almost superstitious fear as he looked
at this sinister representative of its race. It
was more deadly than a cobra, if it could
bite you! All the stories he had ever heard
of the poisonous air that surrounds the
strychnine trees came to him; and that
fabled Valley of Death in Java, grown thick
with upas trees in which nothing can live,
came to mind. He kept his distance from
the dreaded vine, respectfully, and was about
to try to reach Sadok with a call, when voices
coming through the jungle arrested him.
He sank into the undergrowth and watched
through its green depths.</p>

<p>The voices came nearer, guttural tones that
set him shivering with excitement. They
were coming down the ravine on his side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
would pass quite near him, he judged. He
drew his automatic and waited.</p>

<p>Then three diminutive black-bearded warriors
came into view, passing down what must
have been a trail through the jungle, although
he had not noticed any in crossing. They
passed silently through the green glade, and
then two more came into view. Before them
they drove a prisoner, a tall Papuan.</p>

<p>Dwight gasped as he looked to make sure—it
was Baderoon—captured by the pygmies!</p>

<p>All the generous instincts of youth rose up
in him at the sight, and without thinking
further he raised his pistol and fired at the
nearest pygmy. With grunts of surprise
they all bolted into the forest, while Baderoon
leaped into the jungle and came running
toward him, his arms bound behind his back.
Dwight raised his helmet out of the underbrush
an instant so Baderoon could find him,
and then sank out of sight. An arrow came
singing and tanging through the twigs, and
then Baderoon stumbled into his lair and fell
at his feet.</p>

<p>“<i>Orang-kichil!</i> Cut!” he gasped, turning
over on his face. Dwight drew his hunting
knife and severed the fibers that bound him.
Baderoon wriggled over, his face alight with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
its happy, care-free Papuan smile. Then
came the grim lines of pain as he bore stoically
the throes of returning circulation in
his arms. Dwight kept up a cautious vigil,
expecting momentarily an arrow from some
unseen source in the jungle. And the presence
of the deadly upas vine behind him did
not leave any illusions as to how that
arrow would be armed!</p>

<p>Still the stealthy silence! It was his first
taste of real jungle fighting, and the boy
would gladly have exchanged it for any
amount of odds in the open, where one could
see and think. Not a bush moved, not a
stick cracked; the pygmies might have utterly
vanished from the earth, for any sign that
the jungle gave to the contrary.</p>

<p>Then came the call of the Papuan lory,
twice repeated. It was not far off, and it
roused Dwight to a frenzy of hard thinking.
The curator and Nicky, with perhaps Sadok,
also, were coming, having heard his pistol
shot. They must be warned at any hazards.
To move from his place of concealment was
death. He cudgeled his brains for an answer,
turning over one plan after another rapidly
and rejecting them all.</p>

<p>Three of anything means “Danger!” in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
wilderness, all over the world; such a signal
they would at once comprehend, and act
accordingly. Three pistol shots would give
his location away by their smoke. Dwight
raised his voice and gave the lory call three
times in answer.</p>

<p>Bows instantly twanged in the jungle, and
two arrows swished through the thickets
around his position. Dwight took off his
helmet and peered furtively through every
vista, searching every tree trunk, but not a
sign could he discover whence they came.</p>

<p>Then came the cough of Sadok’s sumpitan
from somewhere, and a small black-bearded
hill man rose suddenly out of the bushes, not
thirty feet away, and fell over backward,
silently.</p>

<p>“Me go! Me-fellah catch’m bow’n arrow!”
whispered Baderoon, from the ground, wringing
his wrists vigorously and eying Dwight’s
hunting knife longingly.</p>

<p>Dwight nodded approval. Two could play
at this bushwhacking game! And none better
than their own native bushman. He handed
Baderoon the knife and the Papuan melted
off into the undergrowth toward the body of
the dead pygmy.</p>

<p>A long, sinister silence set in. Dwight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
watched in every direction, scanning the
forest intensely through his leafy screen, but
nothing that he could fire at appeared. Then
a sudden shock of fright went through him.
Surely that bush over there was much nearer
now than when he had looked at it last!
Surely it was not natural, growing so close to
the roots of that giant euphorbia that towered
up near it! Nature did not grow bushes in
such dense shade! He was about to fire into
it, when a long black arm struck out from
behind the tree trunk and there was a flash
of bright steel, while the bush writhed in
convulsions and then lay still.</p>

<p>Baderoon! In spite of his religious taboo
against steel, he had broken it for them.
Dwight could appreciate that, and he began
to have immense confidence in their two wild
allies. In the jungle, where he and the
curator and Nicky were helpless, these two
were masters. They could beat the pygmies
at their own game.</p>

<p>“That’s three,” muttered the boy to himself.
Then the essential need to prevent the
other two getting away to the main war
parties of the pygmies and telling them of
their presence presented itself. It seemed
vital, to the boy’s imagination, and he even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
thought of sacrificing himself by exposing
his position to draw their fire, so that they
could be shot by the others and their plans
for running the gantlet during the storm
could go through.</p>

<p>He was maturing the idea, when a faint
rustle in the jungle back of him turned him
around, with the hair rising under his helmet
with alarm and his pistol ready for instant
fire. He saw Sadok’s sumpitan rise up cautiously
out of the green and lowered again, and
the boy breathed relievedly. Presently he
caught a glimpse of the Dyak’s brown body
moving serpentlike toward the upas vine. Out
of the depths between it and the trunk of the
larger tree overhead the leaves moved. Then
came a quick, silent jab of Sadok’s kriss into
the blood-red bark of the vine. It flashed
down again, and Dwight could see the thick,
white juice oozing from the wound in the
bark. Two brown hands rose out of the
foliage and tied on the tiny bamboo poison
cup with gingerly care, and then all signs of
movement in that direction ceased.</p>

<p>After a long wait, two low calls of the lory
came out of the jungle near by. Dwight
answered them.</p>

<p>“Come on out, Dwight,” came the curator’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
voice. “They’re gone. We’re over this
way.”</p>

<p>Dwight rose hesitatingly, inch by inch,
half expecting every moment to be pierced
by a deadly arrow. Then came the exhilaration
of freedom. He felt wonderfully alive,
eager and able to perform prodigies. He
sought out the party, stepping as if on air,
his eyes sparkling with an unearthly brilliance.
The curator regarded him curiously as he
came up.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo! What’s struck you, old top?”
he exclaimed, vivaciously. “You look as if
you’d seen an angel! Mostly devils around
here. Baderoon tells me there were only five
of them. They ambushed him and trussed
him up before he could make a kick or a
jump. We got two, and two more got away.
The third is outlying somewhere, with Sadok
and Baderoon looking for him.”</p>

<p>“I got that one, myself,” said Dwight.
“That was the pistol shot you heard. He was
walking just in front of Baderoon. And I
found your upas vine, too!” he cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Ah, that accounts for it,” mused the
curator. “Been lying near it a long while?”</p>

<p>“Accounts for what? Yes, I was right
near it, ever since I fired that shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Accounts for your looking like a man
who has eaten loco weed, son. You’ll be lit
up for a while yet; and you need to, for we’ve
got to make a dash, now that those two got
away. There’s a faint essence of strychnia
in the air around the upas vine which acts
like medicine on a human being through the
pores, Dwight,” he explained. “You’ll think
you can move mountains and perform prodigies
of valor, for a time. Then will come
the reaction, like a man drunk with too much
coffee. Well, boys—let’s go.”</p>

<p>He raised the lory call to bring in Sadok
and Baderoon. They rejoined the party soon,
and Dwight noted that the former had the
small tube of fresh poison at his belt.</p>

<p>The party pushed on vigorously. As they
swept into the valley where the pygmies were
camped, thunderclouds gathered overhead
and drops of rain began to fall. It grew dark
and compass ranges had to be corrected again.
Then came the tropical thunder and lightning
with the blinding downpour of rain, so that the
three white men were glad to shroud themselves
in their tent flies. It was a weird march,
through the tossing forest, with rain swirling
through the trunks in white sheets, and flying
dead branches crashing down through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
grinding limbs. Sadok and Baderoon flanked
the party on ahead; so long as neither of
them came in, it was understood to be safe
to push on at full speed. Their course aimed
to pass midway between two of the fires
noted from the mountain above, and then
turn and strike direct for Cassowary Camp.
Baderoon was now well armed, with a bow
and shield and plentiful arrows taken from
the slain pygmies, and Sadok’s quiver was
full of fresh darts, so that a feeling of elation
filled them as they swept on. The forest
was noisy and windriven with the storm;
the snap of broken twigs and the rending of
vines and creepers in their path did not have
to be guarded against now. Their only
danger was in being seen by some outlying
scout, for whose abolishment they trusted
their native allies.</p>

<p>At length the curator pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve made it, boys!” he exulted.
“At the rate we have been going we must
be well past those camps. We’ll bear over
to the left now, and pick up Sadok. Shove
along, boys, faster!—so we can catch up to
him!”</p>

<p>They ran through the jungle, bursting and
tearing their way through the undergrowth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
twisting around trunks and dodging under
creepers. Still no Sadok. The curator called
at intervals, and they pushed on, but no reply
came. Then he stopped and raised the lory
screech at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>It was answered by a faint, single call, a
short distance ahead. With a quick sense
of foreboding they moved forward warily.
Then their eyes lit on a brown, muscular
figure lying by a tree trunk in the dim light of
the roaring jungle—Sadok!</p>

<p>They flung themselves on the ground with
one common impulse, and crept rapidly
forward. Sadok was still alive when they
reached him. His eyes looked over at the
curator sleepily.</p>

<p>Then he pointed with three of his outstretched
fingers, indicating the directions
with a significant brush of his left forefinger
swept out over the others. He fell over on
his side with the effort and closed his eyes.
A long arrow stuck out from the tree over
his head and its carmine tip was covered
with a whitish glaze that made one shiver
to look at it. Blood flowed from a slight
scratch on Sadok’s shoulder, where the arrow
had merely scraped it. The curator leaped
at the wound, sucking fiercely at it. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
shook Sadok roughly, and, reaching for the
medicine box in his hip pocket, poured a
pellet into his hand and forced it between
the Dyak’s teeth. Then he rubbed a pinch
of purple powder into the cut and called on
the boys to help. Together they rolled him
back and forth vigorously. While they were
at it, another arrow whizzed like a hornet
between their heads. They dragged Sadok
behind the tree, while Nicky stood guard
with his long-barreled .38. He could see
nothing in the direction the arrow had come
from, but the little hill men were somewhere
around them now, that was certain.</p>

<p>Between them, Dwight and the curator
had got the Dyak moving feebly again, and,
dragging and pulling him roughly, they all
managed to crawl on through the jungle.
Once lost in the underbrush, safety was
assured by vigilance, for their adversaries
dared not show themselves, either. It grew
steadily darker, and the crash and boom of
thunder kept up unceasingly. Now and then
the vivid flashes would light up the dark
glades and a black form would be seen through
the trees, when the insignificant <i>pop!</i> of the
pistols would ring out.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, it’s dark enough to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
time!” said the curator, halting the party.
“Here are two poles that I picked up while
crawling along. Make a stretcher of them,
and you two carry Sadok, while I cover your
retreat.”</p>

<p>They rolled a tent fly around the two poles
and laid Sadok on the narrow strip of canvas
left in between them, while the curator crept
off into the jungle to reconnoiter. The
crash of Nicky’s revolver in his hands came
to them once, and after a time he returned
and they rose to push on. The Dyak was
heavy, and the two boys staggered along,
forcing their way through maddening vines
and thorn ropes that tore at them in the dark.
Behind them, somewhere, was the curator,
covering the slow retreat, circling through
the forest, occasionally visible when a lightning
flash lit up the jungle with its vivid glare.</p>

<p>Once or twice the red flash of his pistol
spat out in the dark, and once the sharp blow
of an arrow on his back caused Dwight to
drop his burden hastily, while Nicky tore it
out of his clothing anxiously and made sure
that it had not penetrated to the skin.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and then, utterly weary,
the boys fell in a heap, pulled down by the
wrench of some particularly obstinate vine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
in their path. They waited for the curator
despondently. They could do no more. Suddenly
Sadok sat up, as if in a trance. He
did not speak, but the boys, delighted with
this evidence of returning power, pounced
on him and pumped his arms and legs with
all their strength. They were still at it
when the curator returned.</p>

<p>“Glory, Mr. Baldwin—he’s coming round!”
yelped Nicky, looking up from his work.
“He’s going to get over it!”</p>

<p>“Looks promising!” smiled the curator, getting
out another pellet to give Sadok. “We
can thank the rain for that! No arrow can
stay virulent long in this weather! Raise him
to his feet and we’ll try to make him walk.”</p>

<p>They propped Sadok up and, half carrying
him, half leading him, they set out again.
He staggered along as if walking in his sleep,
leaning heavily against first one and then the
other of the boys. Gradually the rain abated
and the lightning flashes grew less frequent,
so that it was necessary for the curator to
stop and crouch in the jungle to light up the
compass with his flasher concealed under
the tent robe. Then came pitch blackness,
and the dripping silent jungle hid them like
a shroud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I’m afraid we’ve lost Baderoon, boys,”
whispered the curator during a stop to take
a bearing. “He had plenty of chance to
locate us, back there in the storm, we did so
much firing. I’ve had to reload entirely,
once. You can’t have more than six shots
left, Nick.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a clip and a half, sir,” interrupted
Dwight, cheerily, “and what is more,
Sadok will be in shape again soon. I’ve
noticed his muscles flexing occasionally, of
their own steam, while helping him walk.
Let’s go. We’ve got two good hours of this
yet!”</p>

<p>His artificial buoyancy and untiring energy
were a great asset to the tired party now,
and they pushed on faster, with Sadok walking
almost normally. Mile after mile was
passed, and then a glimpse of the stars showed
occasionally through the tree tops. They
were tired to the limit, but Dwight, under
his strange stimulant, pushed on as fresh as
if just out of his sleeping bag. Dawn came
at length, to sift its dim light through the
jungle. It found them still on the march,
with Sadok walking unaided, occasionally
muttering an incoherent word of Malay.</p>

<p>Then came the murmur of a brook and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
burst out of the jungle, to splash across it
into the open glades, with the mountains
towering all around them, their tops hidden
by the rising mists of early daylight. The
party heaved a huge sigh of relief as they
stepped out into the deep wet saw grass.
They were about a mile above Cassowary
Camp, and it was their own stream that they
had crossed. The country looked like home,
indeed, to them, for half a day’s march farther
lay their base camp, the canoe, and freedom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII<br>

<small>THE ESCAPE TO ARU</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SUDDENLY Sadok began to run. The
boys attempted to restrain him, but the
curator held them off.</p>

<p>“Let him alone, boys. His mentality’s
coming back—it’s a good sign. Wait.”</p>

<p>They watched the Dyak, who was now
running in a crouching position, his long
sumpitan trailing over the grass in his left
hand. As he neared a clump of trees out in
the swales he dropped from sight in the grass,
his progress only marked by the waving of
the blades. They searched the tree carefully,
but only what appeared to be a large
black mass, well hidden in the dense foliage,
offered any possible mark.</p>

<p>Then the sumpitan rose slowly out of the
field, and presently a large black bird tumbled
down through the trees. The Dyak was on
his feet in an instant, dashed through the
thicket, and seized his trophy. Then he
came back, holding it up triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Me catch’m new spec’men, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!”
he announced, exuberantly. Gone was the
dull, expressionless look in his eyes, replaced
now by the sparkling zest of the primitive
hunter.</p>

<p>“Boys, he’s got a long-tailed bird of paradise,
by Jove!” cried the curator, excitedly.
“Rarer than the superba! Great work,
Sadok!”</p>

<p>They all ran to him and examined the
prize. It was of glossy black, with bronze
and purple glories of peacock-coal hues,
making the feathers iridescent with changeable
colors. A superb tail of feathers two
feet long, and the side plumage brushed
back, as it were, to form tufts of plumage
along both sides of the back, completed the
bird’s extraordinary ornaments.</p>

<p>“Almost makes you forget the pygmies,
eh, Sadok?” grinned the curator, suggestively.</p>

<p>The Dyak’s face looked blank. Then his
memory began slowly, painfully to work, and
he put up his hand slowly and felt the bandage
on his shoulder. Gradually his expression
changed to comprehension, anger, disgust.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” he shuddered. “Me kill’m two—t’ree!
Then me know nothing. Me come
hit—arrow?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Yep. We found you. Carried you through
the jungle for miles. Me cure’m upas [poison].
All well now!”</p>

<p>A kind of wonder grew in the Dyak’s eyes.
It was the first time in his experience that
any man had survived a poisoned arrow.</p>

<p>“<i>Orang-kaya!</i> him know everyt’ing!” he
cried. “Him God—big-fellah!” He stooped
down and embraced the curator’s knees adoringly.</p>

<p>“Here! Cut it!” said the curator, embarrassed,
as he disengaged himself, and there
were tears in his eyes. “God Him <i>great</i> big-fellah,
Sadok! Him live in sky. Him hold
the world in his hand, so, Sadok,” holding
out his cupped hand. “Him make you-fellah
save my life, plenty much; make
me-fellah save your life! Me tell you ’bout
Him, some day, Sadok,” he said, affectionately,
laying his hand on the Dyak’s shoulder.
“Gad! and I don’t know any greater pleasure
than <i>that</i> will be, either!” he exclaimed, under
his breath. “A man’s God is what I will
show him! Come on, fellows!” he broke off,
hastily. “We got to shove along; it would
be death to be caught in these open swales.”</p>

<p>The party marched on down toward the
old site of Cassowary Camp, and were soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
at the familiar grounds where so many adventures
had befallen them and so many happy
days spent in collecting. The mountain
loomed up invitingly behind it, and the
curator led the way up the slopes.</p>

<p>Dwight felt himself stumbling unaccountably.
His eyesight appeared to be wavering,
and the bushes that he grasped at to aid in
climbing seemed to elude his grasp.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baldwin, quick! I’m fainting!” he
gasped, weakly, and he pitched forward on
his face, his arms still reaching uphill.</p>

<p>They all stopped.</p>

<p>“The reaction has come,” said the curator.
“He’ll be better soon. I think we can risk
an hour’s stop and get some rest and something
to eat.”</p>

<p>His eye roved the mountain side, and
finally rested on a rocky ledge with bowlders
and thickets of thorny bushes on its brink.</p>

<p>“Carry him up there,” he ordered. “We’ll
dig in there and lay low for a bit.”</p>

<p>They brought him up, and the curator
applied restoratives, while Nicky and Sadok
busied themselves in rolling bowlders and
making the place as impregnable as possible.
Then Nicky got out his alcohol kit, with a
joke or two about its being the only camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
fire worth a whoop, and started cooking a
soup for all, composed of dried pemmican
and soup powder.</p>

<p>The site commanded the swales below for
miles. To the left lay the pebbly bars of
the creek, with the old trail of the Outanatas
entering the jungle like a green tunnel.
With ammunition, they could hold this place
for a long time, at least until flanking parties
had ascended the mountain back of them,
but their supply was now reduced to only a
few cartridges.</p>

<p>The curator studied the situation over
uneasily.</p>

<p>“I do wish Dwight could move!” he said
to Nicky at his right. “We might try carrying
him, but it seems suicidal to me. The
pygmies are coming, sure as death, and
they’ll move much faster than we could go
with a burden. We’d be overtaken before
we got halfway back to the canoe. We’ll
have to stay here and fight. After the
ammunition is all gone, every man make
for that canoe at top speed. The first one
there will get sail on her and wait until
forced to draw out to the lagoon. That is
about all I can plan ahead at the present.
Too bad we lost Baderoon,” he sighed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
“That was the finest black boy I ever knew!
No one who ever knew that happy, rollicking
native could help loving him—and I rather
depended on him getting through and bringing
up the Outanatas.”</p>

<p>He went over to where Dwight lay in the
shade of a bush.</p>

<p>“How’s it coming, old man?”</p>

<p>“I’m weak as a cat,” said Dwight, lifelessly.
“I can’t even move that arm. Pull
it in out of the sun and lay it across my chest,
won’t you?” he begged, querulously.</p>

<p>The curator shook his head. It would
be at least another hour before Dwight could
even move his own legs. The curator fidgeted
with impatience as he cursed the upas vine
and all its relatives. Hours were precious
as dear life, now. He had about decided on
a scheme for pushing along and carrying
Dwight in relays, when a low whistle from
Nicky brought him to his feet.</p>

<p>“Here they come, sir!” announced the
boy, tensely.</p>

<p>He peered out of their lair. A long line
of the little black men swept across the upper
swales, arrows on bows, walking about fifteen
feet apart, searching warily every foot of
the grass. More burst out of the jungle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
along the creek every few moments, and far
to the right, other parties could be seen
beating across the jungle toward the banyan-tree
mountain. Nothing could escape such
a dragnet!</p>

<p>They watched them impotently, as the
warriors slowly worked down the swales
toward their position. There were at least
fifty of them in the line that finally reached
the site of Cassowary Camp. Then they
began to slowly filter up the mountain side.</p>

<p>“Now’s our only chance!” said the curator
in a low voice. “Sadok, you pick off any
that come near this position, or any that seem
likely to discover us, and we’ll hope that the
rest may go by without finding us.”</p>

<p>“How about their finding the canoe before
we do?” suggested Nicky, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that. We’ve got to
move as soon as they pass us, and get Dwight
along somehow. Sadok and I will carry
him. We’ll have to beat ’em to it.”</p>

<p>A pygmy came out of the bushes directly
below him, and his little black eyes popped
with sudden discovery. Before he could
utter a yell a dart from Sadok’s sumpitan
ended him. Then another appeared, working
uphill to their right, and he, too, was tumbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
over in a silent heap. The curator felt a
touch on his arm. He turned his head, to
see Dwight, who had crawled over on hands
and knees, and he was pointing up to their
left with a look of horror in his eyes. There
stood a pygmy in plain sight in the act of
raising the warwhoop!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_226fp.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THE PISTOLS BARKED IN UNISON WITH THE<br>
HIGH-PITCHED YELL THAT THE MAN LET OUT</p>

<p>The pistols barked in unison with the
high-pitched yell that the man let out. There
were swift rustlings all over the mountain
side, and a knot of warriors below charged
up the hill, shouting their battle cries. The
curator dropped a shell on them. A great
brown geyser of earth and stones obliterated
the group, simultaneous with its thundering
report, and the jungle below burst into flames
with the intense heat of the explosion. In
another instant there was not a pygmy in
sight anywhere on the whole landscape.</p>

<p>“Now, then, cut and run for it!” hissed the
curator. “Make for the canoe, Nick, and
get sail on her. We’ll come along with
Dwight, somehow!”</p>

<p>Nicky darted off into the jungle to their
left, while Sadok and the curator hoisted
Dwight to his feet and started off along the
rocky side of the mountain. They saw a
party of the pygmies scuttling along in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
valley below to get ahead of them. Stopping
an instant to aim, the curator drove another
shell down on them. Its detonation was
followed by a sudden silence, and then out
of the green depths of the jungle across the
creek burst a full, deep-throated war chant.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ko! Ko! Ko!</div>
<div class="verse">Hy-<i>yah!</i> Hy-<i>yah!</i> Hy-<i>yah!</i></div>
<div class="verse">To-yah-hyah! To-yah-hyah!</div>
<div class="verse">Ko! Ko! Ko!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The curator stopped, exulting. These were
<i>men</i>!—not the little, dwarfed aborigines of
the hills, but big, tall, deep-chested men—the
Outanatas!</p>

<p>He scarce dared to hope. An arrow whispered
through the jungle over his shoulder,
but he heeded it not, his eyes fixed on that
open green tunnel that opened out on the
creek bank. The marching song continued,
and he got glimpses of spears and white-scrolled
shields moving along through the
greens of the forest below. Then a tall chief
stood in the mouth of the tunnel, his face
hideously streaked with white marks, and,
hanging like an apron from his girdle, was
the curator’s flaming red bandanna. It was
the war chief of the Outanatas—and behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
him came Baderoon, pointing and urging
them on vigorously!</p>

<p>The curator cupped his hands.</p>

<p>“Baderoon! Baderoon! Here we are!”
he yelled. Then he and Sadok laid Dwight
down under a rock ledge and sought ambushes.
Yells and war cries sounded from the mountain
side all about them as the long line of
Outanata warriors splashed across the creek,
brandishing their weapons. Parties of
pygmies formed for the assault in the swales.
The occasional cough of Sadok’s sumpitan
at different places on the mountain showed
that he was outlying and picking off men
here and there.</p>

<p>Then a knot of the pygmies gathered below
the curator, evidently bent on taking the
Outanatas in the rear. He aimed carefully
into the midst of them and fired his third
shell. Its stunning report was the signal for
a general attack, for the Outanatas dashed
out into the grass country, a cloud of arrows
preceding them, while javelins soared and
poised in the air, to sink out of sight in the
long grass.</p>

<p>Baderoon came running up the hill through
the jungle.</p>

<p>“Me get’m! Me fetch’m, <i>Orang-kaya</i>!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
Come! No good for white man be here.”
He was fully armed, and exuberant with
delight and high spirits. The curator called
in Sadok, and they raised Dwight to his feet
and set off at full speed, with the Dyak covering
their retreat. The boy was fast getting
his strength back now, and they went along
rapidly. As they left the plateau the curator
looked back. The whole country behind
him was full of tall and short black men,
fighting like demons, catching arrows on
ready shields, jabbing at each other with
long spears, and occasionally the white flash
of a bamboo knife would tell where one of a
pair had come off victorious.</p>

<p>That was his last glimpse of Papuan and
pygmy, for the way led down abruptly into
their valley, and soon they were crossing the
strip of deep jungle and had arrived on the
coral bank. A shout for Nicky, answered
by a low whistle, brought them to the stream
bank, where the old white sail of the small
proa showed up through the thickets. Nicky
had already gotten the crate aboard and was
all ready to shove off. They tumbled in,
and Baderoon took the helm, while Sadok
drew in the sheet rope. The creek banks
slid swiftly by, and presently they were out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
in the lagoon and headed down it toward the
capes of the open sea.</p>

<p>“Good-by, New Guinea!” shouted the
curator, waving his hand at the column of
smoke that rose far back in the hills. “Some
day the white race will need you—but it’s
a long, long way off yet, boys!” he laughed,
dropping his voice. “And now let’s have
those cinnabar specimens,” he added, as the
proa swept along like a swallow under the
fresh breeze. “Mum’s the word about them,
everybody,” he warned. “It’s the one big
secret of the expedition.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll see you next as president
of the New Guinea Mining Company, Limited,
Mr. Baldwin?” laughed Nicky, who was
busily whittling at a short bamboo stick he
had brought aboard.</p>

<p>“That opens up a big subject, boys,”
answered the curator, seriously. “If either
of you want a big position in such a company,
just say the word and it’s yours. You’ll be
rich and prosperous beyond your dreams.”</p>

<p>“And you, Mr. Baldwin?” inquired Dwight,
curiously.</p>

<p>“Such temptations are not for me,” replied
the curator. “When I’ve reported this thing
to certain financiers, I’m through. My whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
life has been that of a scientist, a seeker after
knowledge. When I have found a new thing
my interest in it ceases. As a wanderer
and an explorer I am happy; as a wealthy
mine owner I’d be miserable. All my education
has been in the service of science; it’s
the only life for me.”</p>

<p>“Me, too!” grunted Nicky, splitting his
bamboo wand and sticking a small sliver in
it to hold it open. “And, there’s one specimen
from New Guinea that I <i>didn’t</i> get, and
that’s a sea snake. You can have your mine
for all of me!”</p>

<p>“By George! that’s the way I feel, too!”
exclaimed Dwight. “The engineers and the
moneyed men can have Red Mountain, for
all I care. I’d far rather collect a new
butterfly in some out-of-the-way hole than
own a million dollars. All I want is to
be with you on your next expedition, Mr.
Baldwin.”</p>

<p>The curator looked into their eyes understandingly.</p>

<p>“It’s the way we naturalists all feel,” he
said, appreciatively. “Enough to live on
and the chance to do something for science
is happiness to us. Sadok and I are going
into the interior of Borneo next, and I’d be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
delighted to have you with me. Your characters
are pretty well formed now; all this
that we’ve gone through has simply hardened
them, so I know I can depend on you—and
that’s the most precious knowledge any man
can have—”</p>

<p>“<i>There’s</i> one! Port your helm, Baderoon!”
came from Nicky. They looked around, to
see a sea snake swimming carelessly along,
his head a foot out of the water. He was
afraid of nothing and stuck out his tongue
warningly as the proa sheered toward him.
Then his oarlike tail flashed into swift motion
and he shot along by their gunwale, but
Nicky was too quick for him, and with a
swift jab of his wand brought him aboard,
squirming and striking furiously from the
cleft in which he was caught.</p>

<p>“Look out! He’s highly venomous!”
warned Nicky, coming aft. “Watch out—he’s
getting away!”</p>

<p>The snake dropped to the bottom of the
canoe and darted up its side. With a swift
clip of the rod Nicky broke his neck, and the
“specimen” lay squirming aimlessly in the
bottom of the boat as they all watched it
narrowly.</p>

<p>“He’ll be ready for skinning out presently,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
chirped Nicky, cheerily. “As a snakist I’ve
got you fellows backed into the cellar!”</p>

<p>The proa had now run down opposite the
capes, and the swell of the open sea slid her
about like an airplane. That mountainous
coast is always windy and stormy, and it
was making the usual squally weather now.
The proa bucked and plunged like a racehorse,
her lee outrigger buried in foam, the
weather one clipping the tops of combers,
while the three whites sat out on the bamboo
wings that hung out from each side on the
outrigger braces like a basket. It was a
wild and exceedingly wet ride, the proa
careening down the wave slopes like a hawk
and soaring almost bodily out of water when
lifted up on the white-capped combers.</p>

<p>The land dropped swiftly astern; towering
up into heavy banks of clouds rose the dark
ranges of the Charles Louis Mountains, with
the woolly pyramids of the afternoon thunderheads
gathering in the sky back over the
interior. It was their last look at Dutch
New Guinea, for soon the cloud banks lowered
and ugly squall clouds, like long dark cigars,
swept across the horizon, shutting them in
in the gray circle of the sea. A chip thrown
over the side and timed by the curator’s watch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
showed a speed of nearly ten knots. At that
rate they would reach Aru at night—a landfall
that would be dangerous in the extreme
until the stars came out and the sea went
down.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the curator shortened sail,
reefing the lateen down to half its original
bulk. The proa now labored and wallowed,
keeping at least one of them bailing vigorously.
She was an able boat in the eyes of
her original owners, no doubt; but then
water, more or less, was nothing in their
naked philosophy!</p>

<p>Then came the rain, beating the sea flat
and drenching them to the skin. Through
the smother of it the proa drove on steadily,
laying her course for Aru as close as possible
on the starboard tack. Later fell a flat calm
and the stars came out. She rolled incredibly
in the smooth, welling billows, but gradually
these went down, until by midnight all was
quiet and they lay drifting idly on the black
bosom of the Banda Sea. Now and then the
phosphorescent wake of a large shark would
pass them, but finally this interest, too,
waned, and everyone fell asleep except the
curator, who had volunteered to take the
watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>He sat dreaming under the stars, the sail
hanging out idly and scarcely straightening
the sheet. A gentle gurgle of phosphorescent
fire eddied from the captured Papuan paddle
that they had used for a rudder. The dim
forms of his companions lay huddled in the
dark, lying on the bamboo framework over
the outrigger poles.</p>

<p>The curator regarded them with feelings
of quiet satisfaction. Their dash into Dutch
New Guinea had been a success. They had
brought back an immensely valuable natural-history
collection, and mineral information
to the world that would soon add a vigorous
trade settlement to those two forlorn Dutch
military posts, six hundred miles apart, on
a wild and savage coast. But above all he
rejoiced in the spiritual results of the expedition
with deepest pride. Those two boys
had shown courage and resourcefulness far
beyond their years; they had faced privation,
danger, and battle with a grit and determination,
a cheerfulness and lack of grouch, that
had proved them men after his own heart.
And to serve the cause of science they had
refused the opportunity for fabulous wealth
and all the ease and comfort that money can
give. With them and his two devoted natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the curator felt that he had a scientific organization
that would do. Yes, it would do
mighty well!</p>

<p>He smoked on, thinking silently as the
hours slipped by. Finally a light breeze,
the precursor of dawn, sprang up, and the
proa slipped quietly along, little rills of water
trickling against her planks. It grew light
in the east, and after a time out of the mists
in the west developed the solid cloud banks,
pierced with pale outlines of islets, hill, and
jungle, of the shore line of Aru.</p>

<p>“Land ho!” yelled the curator, waking
them all up. “Here’s Aru, boys, dead ahead,
and we’ve beaten our proa that was to have
come for us by two days!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
